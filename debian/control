Description: distributed storage and file system
 Ceph is a massively scalable, open-source, distributed
 storage system that runs on commodity hardware and delivers object,
 block and file system storage.
 .
 This package contains all server daemons and management tools for creating,
 running, and administering a Ceph storage cluster, with the exception of the
 metadata server, which is necessary for using the distributed file system and is
 provided by the ceph-mds package.

Description: FUSE-based client for the Ceph distributed file system
 Ceph is a massively scalable, open-source, distributed
 storage system that runs on commodity hardware and delivers object,

 limitations, it is recommended that the native Linux kernel client
 be used if possible.  If it is not practical to load a kernel module
 (insufficient privileges, older kernel, etc.), then the FUSE client will
 do.
