 CRUSH Maps
============

The :abbr:`CRUSH (Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing)` algorithm
determines how to store and retrieve data by computing data storage locations.
CRUSH empowers Ceph clients to communicate with OSDs directly rather than
through a centralized server or broker. With an algorithmically determined
method of storing and retrieving data, Ceph avoids a single point of failure, a
performance bottleneck, and a physical limit to its scalability.

CRUSH requires a map of your cluster, and uses the CRUSH map to pseudo-randomly 
store and retrieve data in OSDs with a uniform distribution of data across the 
cluster. For a detailed discussion of CRUSH, see 
`CRUSH - Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data`_

CRUSH maps contain a list of :abbr:`OSDs (Object Storage Devices)`, a list of
'buckets' for aggregating the devices into physical locations, and a list of
rules that tell CRUSH how it should replicate data in a Ceph cluster's pools. By
reﬂecting the underlying physical organization of the installation, CRUSH can
model—and thereby address—potential sources of correlated device failures.
Typical sources include physical proximity, a shared power source, and a shared
network. By encoding this information into the cluster map, CRUSH placement
policies can separate object replicas across different failure domains while
still maintaining the desired distribution. For example, to address the
possibility of concurrent failures, it may be desirable to ensure that data
replicas are on devices using different shelves, racks, power supplies,
controllers, and/or physical locations.

When you create a configuration file and deploy Ceph with ``ceph-deploy``, Ceph
generates a default CRUSH map for your configuration. The default CRUSH map is
fine for your Ceph sandbox environment. However, when you deploy a large-scale
data cluster, you should give significant consideration to developing a custom
CRUSH map, because it will help you manage your Ceph cluster, improve
performance and ensure data safety. 

For example, if an OSD goes down, a CRUSH map can help you can locate
the physical data center, room, row and rack of the host with the failed OSD in
the event you need to use onsite support or replace hardware. 

Similarly, CRUSH may help you identify faults more quickly. For example, if all
OSDs in a particular rack go down simultaneously, the fault may lie with a
network switch or power to the rack or the network switch rather than the 
OSDs themselves.

A custom CRUSH map can also help you identify the physical locations where
Ceph stores redundant copies of data when the placement group(s) associated
with a failed host are in a degraded state.

`Inktank`_ provides excellent premium support for developing CRUSH maps.

CRUSH Location
==============

The location of an OSD in terms of the CRUSH map's hierarchy is referred to
as a 'crush location'.  This location specifier takes the form of a list of
key and value pairs describing a position.  For example, if an OSD is in a
particular row, rack, chassis and host, and is part of the 'default' CRUSH 
tree, its crush location could be described as::

  root=default row=a rack=a2 chassis=a2a host=a2a1

Note:

#. Note that the order of the keys does not matter.
#. The key name (left of ``=``) must be a valid CRUSH ``type``.  By default
   these include root, datacenter, room, row, pod, pdu, rack, chassis and host, 
   but those types can be customized to be anything appropriate by modifying 
   the CRUSH map.
#. Not all keys need to be specified.  For example, by default, Ceph
   automatically sets a ``ceph-osd`` daemon's location to be
   ``root=default host=HOSTNAME`` (based on the output from ``hostname -s``).

ceph-crush-location hook
------------------------

By default, the ``ceph-crush-location`` utility will generate a CRUSH
location string for a given daemon.  The location is based on, in order of
preference:

#. A ``TYPE crush location`` option in ceph.conf.  For example, this
   is ``osd crush location`` for OSD daemons.
#. A ``crush location`` option in ceph.conf.
#. A default of ``root=default host=HOSTNAME`` where the hostname is
   generated with the ``hostname -s`` command.

In a typical deployment scenario, provisioning software (or the system
administrator) can simply set the 'crush location' field in a host's
ceph.conf to describe that machine's location within the datacenter or
cluster.  This will be provide location awareness to both Ceph daemons
and clients alike.

It is possible to manage the CRUSH map entirely manually by toggling
the hook off in the configuration::

  osd crush update on start = false

Custom location hooks
---------------------

A customize location hook can be used in place of the generic hook for OSD
daemon placement in the hierarchy.  (On startup, each OSD ensure its position is
correct.)::

  osd crush location hook = /path/to/script

This hook is passed several arguments (below) and should output a single line
to stdout with the CRUSH location description.::

  $ ceph-crush-location --cluster CLUSTER --id ID --type TYPE

where the cluster name is typically 'ceph', the id is the daemon
identifier (the OSD number), and the daemon type is typically ``osd``.


Editing a CRUSH Map
===================

To edit an existing CRUSH map:

#. `Get the CRUSH map`_.
#. `Decompile`_ the CRUSH map.
#. Edit at least one of `Devices`_, `Buckets`_ and `Rules`_.
#. `Recompile`_ the CRUSH map.
#. `Set the CRUSH map`_.

To activate CRUSH Map rules for a specific pool, identify the common ruleset
number for those rules and specify that ruleset number for the pool. See `Set
Pool Values`_ for details. 

.. _Get the CRUSH map: #getcrushmap
.. _Decompile: #decompilecrushmap
.. _Devices: #crushmapdevices
.. _Buckets: #crushmapbuckets
.. _Rules: #crushmaprules
.. _Recompile: #compilecrushmap
.. _Set the CRUSH map: #setcrushmap
.. _Set Pool Values: ../pools#setpoolvalues

.. _getcrushmap:

Get a CRUSH Map
---------------

To get the CRUSH map for your cluster, execute the following:: 

	ceph osd getcrushmap -o {compiled-crushmap-filename}

Ceph will output (-o) a compiled CRUSH map to the filename you specified. Since
the CRUSH map is in a compiled form, you must decompile it first before you can
edit it. 

.. _decompilecrushmap:

Decompile a CRUSH Map
---------------------

To decompile a CRUSH map, execute the following:: 

	crushtool -d {compiled-crushmap-filename} -o {decompiled-crushmap-filename}

Ceph will decompile (-d) the compiled CRUSH map and output (-o) it to the 
filename you specified.


.. _compilecrushmap:

Compile a CRUSH Map
-------------------

To compile a CRUSH map, execute the following:: 

	crushtool -c {decompiled-crush-map-filename} -o {compiled-crush-map-filename}

Ceph will store a compiled CRUSH map to the filename you specified. 


.. _setcrushmap:

Set a CRUSH Map
---------------

To set the CRUSH map for your cluster, execute the following:: 

	ceph osd setcrushmap -i  {compiled-crushmap-filename}

Ceph will input the compiled CRUSH map of the filename you specified as the
CRUSH map for the cluster.



CRUSH Map Parameters
====================

There are four main sections to a CRUSH Map. 

#. **Devices:** Devices consist of any object storage device--i.e., the storage
   drive corresponding to a ``ceph-osd`` daemon. You should have a device for
   each OSD daemon in your Ceph configuration file.
   
#. **Bucket Types**: Bucket ``types`` define the types of buckets used in your 
   CRUSH hierarchy. Buckets consist of a hierarchical aggregation of storage 
   locations (e.g., rows, racks, chassis, hosts, etc.) and their assigned 
   weights.

#. **Bucket Instances:** Once you define bucket types, you must declare bucket 
   instances for your hosts, and any other failure domain partitioning
   you choose.

#. **Rules:** Rules consist of the manner of selecting buckets. 

If you launched Ceph using one of our Quick Start guides, you'll notice 
that you didn't need to create a CRUSH map. Ceph's deployment tools generate 
a default CRUSH map that lists devices from the OSDs you defined in your 
Ceph configuration file, and it declares a bucket for each host you specified
in the ``[osd]`` sections of your Ceph configuration file. You should create
your own CRUSH maps with buckets that reflect your cluster's failure domains 
to better ensure data safety and availability.

.. note:: The generated CRUSH map doesn't take your larger grained failure 
   domains into account. So you should modify your CRUSH map to account for
   larger grained failure domains such as chassis, racks, rows, data 
   centers, etc.



.. _crushmapdevices:

CRUSH Map Devices
-----------------

To map placement groups to OSDs, a CRUSH map requires a list of OSD devices
(i.e., the names of the OSD daemons from the Ceph configuration file). The list
of devices appears first in the CRUSH map. To declare a device in the CRUSH map,
create a new line under your list of devices, enter ``device`` followed by a
unique numeric ID, followed by the corresponding ``ceph-osd`` daemon instance.

::

	#devices
	device {num} {osd.name}

For example:: 

	#devices
	device 0 osd.0
	device 1 osd.1
	device 2 osd.2
	device 3 osd.3
	
As a general rule, an OSD daemon maps to a single storage drive or to a RAID.


CRUSH Map Bucket Types
----------------------

The second list in the CRUSH map defines 'bucket' types. Buckets facilitate
a hierarchy of nodes and leaves. Node (or non-leaf) buckets typically represent
physical locations in a hierarchy. Nodes aggregate other nodes or leaves.
Leaf buckets represent ``ceph-osd`` daemons and their corresponding storage
media. 

.. tip:: The term "bucket" used in the context of CRUSH means a node in
   the hierarchy, i.e. a location or a piece of physical hardware. It
   is a different concept from the term "bucket" when used in the
   context of RADOS Gateway APIs.

To add a bucket type to the CRUSH map, create a new line under your list of
bucket types. Enter ``type`` followed by a unique numeric ID and a bucket name.
By convention, there is one leaf bucket and it is ``type 0``;  however, you may
give it any name you like (e.g., osd, disk, drive, storage, etc.)::

	#types
	type {num} {bucket-name}

For example::

	# types
	type 0 osd
	type 1 host
	type 2 chassis
	type 3 rack
	type 4 row
	type 5 pdu
	type 6 pod
	type 7 room
	type 8 datacenter
	type 9 region
	type 10 root



.. _crushmapbuckets:

CRUSH Map Bucket Hierarchy
--------------------------

The CRUSH algorithm distributes data objects among storage devices according 
to a per-device weight value, approximating a uniform probability distribution.
CRUSH distributes objects and their replicas according to the hierarchical 
cluster map you define. Your CRUSH map represents the available storage 
devices and the logical elements that contain them.

To map placement groups to OSDs across failure domains, a CRUSH map defines a
hierarchical list of bucket types (i.e., under ``#types`` in the generated CRUSH
map). The purpose of creating a bucket hierarchy is to segregate the
leaf nodes by their failure domains, such as hosts, chassis, racks, power 
distribution units, pods, rows, rooms, and data centers. With the exception of 
the leaf nodes representing OSDs, the rest of the hierarchy is arbitrary, and 
you may define it according to your own needs.

We recommend adapting your CRUSH map to your firms's hardware naming conventions
and using instances names that reflect the physical hardware. Your naming
practice can make it easier to administer the cluster and troubleshoot
problems when an OSD and/or other hardware malfunctions and the administrator
need access to physical hardware.

In the following example, the bucket hierarchy has a leaf bucket named ``osd``,
and two node buckets named ``host`` and ``rack`` respectively.

.. ditaa:: 
                           +-----------+
                           | {o}rack   | 
                           |   Bucket  |
                           +-----+-----+   
                                 |
                 +---------------+---------------+             
                 |                               |
           +-----+-----+                   +-----+-----+
           | {o}host   |                   | {o}host   |
           |   Bucket  |                   |   Bucket  |           
           +-----+-----+                   +-----+-----+
                 |                               | 
         +-------+-------+               +-------+-------+
         |               |               |               |
   +-----+-----+   +-----+-----+   +-----+-----+   +-----+-----+
   |    osd    |   |    osd    |   |    osd    |   |    osd    |
   |   Bucket  |   |   Bucket  |   |   Bucket  |   |   Bucket  | 
   +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+

.. note:: The higher numbered ``rack`` bucket type aggregates the lower 
   numbered ``host`` bucket type. 

Since leaf nodes reflect storage devices declared under the ``#devices`` list 
at the beginning of the CRUSH map, you do not need to declare them as bucket
instances. The second lowest bucket type in your hierarchy usually aggregates
the devices (i.e., it's usually the computer containing the storage media, and
uses whatever term you prefer to describe it, such as  "node", "computer",
"server," "host", "machine", etc.). In high density environments, it is
increasingly common to see multiple hosts/nodes per chassis. You should account
for chassis failure too--e.g., the need to pull a chassis if a node fails may 
result in bringing down numerous hosts/nodes and their OSDs.

When declaring a bucket instance, you must specify its type, give it a unique
name (string), assign it a unique ID expressed as a negative integer (optional),
specify a weight relative to the total capacity/capability of its item(s),
specify the bucket algorithm (usually ``straw``), and the hash (usually ``0``,
reflecting hash algorithm ``rjenkins1``). A bucket may have one or more items.
The items may consist of node buckets or leaves. Items may have a weight that
reflects the relative weight of the item.

You may declare a node bucket with the following syntax:: 

	[bucket-type] [bucket-name] {
		id [a unique negative numeric ID]
		weight [the relative capacity/capability of the item(s)]
		alg [the bucket type: uniform | list | tree | straw ]
		hash [the hash type: 0 by default]
		item [item-name] weight [weight]	
	}

For example, using the diagram above, we would define two host buckets
and one rack bucket. The OSDs are declared as items within the host buckets::

	host node1 {
		id -1
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item osd.0 weight 1.00
		item osd.1 weight 1.00
	}

	host node2 {
		id -2
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item osd.2 weight 1.00
		item osd.3 weight 1.00
	}

	rack rack1 {
		id -3
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item node1 weight 2.00
		item node2 weight 2.00
	}

.. note:: In the foregoing example, note that the rack bucket does not contain
   any OSDs. Rather it contains lower level host buckets, and includes the 
   sum total of their weight in the item entry.

.. topic:: Bucket Types

   Ceph supports four bucket types, each representing a tradeoff between   
   performance and reorganization efficiency. If you are unsure of which bucket
   type to use, we recommend using a ``straw`` bucket.  For a detailed
   discussion of bucket types, refer to 
   `CRUSH - Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data`_,
   and more specifically to **Section 3.4**. The bucket types are: 
   
	#. **Uniform:** Uniform buckets aggregate devices with **exactly** the same
	   weight. For example, when firms commission or decommission hardware, they 
	   typically do so with many machines that have exactly the same physical
	   configuration (e.g., bulk purchases). When storage devices have exactly 
	   the same weight, you may use the ``uniform`` bucket type, which allows 
	   CRUSH to map replicas into uniform buckets in constant time. With 
	   non-uniform weights, you should use another bucket algorithm.
	
	#. **List**: List buckets aggregate their content as linked lists. Based on 
	   the :abbr:`RUSH (Replication Under Scalable Hashing)` :sub:`P` algorithm,
	   a list is a natural and intuitive choice for an **expanding cluster**: 
	   either an object is relocated to the newest device with some appropriate 
	   probability, or it remains on the older devices as before. The result is 
	   optimal data migration when items are added to the bucket. Items removed 
	   from the middle or tail of the list, however, can result in a signiﬁcant 
	   amount of unnecessary movement, making list buckets most suitable for 
	   circumstances in which they **never (or very rarely) shrink**.
	   
	#. **Tree**: Tree buckets use a binary search tree. They are more efficient
	   than list buckets when a bucket contains a larger set of items. Based on 
	   the :abbr:`RUSH (Replication Under Scalable Hashing)` :sub:`R` algorithm,
	   tree buckets reduce the placement time to O(log :sub:`n`), making them 
	   suitable for managing much larger sets of devices or nested buckets.
	
	#. **Straw:** List and Tree buckets use a divide and conquer strategy 
	   in a way that either gives certain items precedence (e.g., those 
	   at the beginning of a list) or obviates the need to consider entire 
	   subtrees of items at all. That improves the performance of the replica 
	   placement process, but can also introduce suboptimal reorganization 
	   behavior when the contents of a bucket change due an addition, removal, 
	   or re-weighting of an item. The straw bucket type allows all items to 
	   fairly “compete” against each other for replica placement through a 
	   process analogous to a draw of straws.

.. topic:: Hash

   Each bucket uses a hash algorithm. Currently, Ceph supports ``rjenkins1``.
   Enter ``0`` as your hash setting to select ``rjenkins1``.


.. topic:: Weighting Bucket Items

   Ceph expresses bucket weights as doubles, which allows for fine
   weighting. A weight is the relative difference between device capacities. We
   recommend using ``1.00`` as the relative weight for a 1TB storage device.
   In such a scenario, a weight of ``0.5`` would represent approximately 500GB,
   and a weight of ``3.00`` would represent approximately 3TB. Higher level 
   buckets have a weight that is the sum total of the leaf items aggregated by
   the bucket.
   
   A bucket item weight is one dimensional, but you may also calculate your 
   item weights to reflect the performance of the storage drive. For example, 
   if you have many 1TB drives where some have relatively low data transfer 
   rate and the others have a relatively high data transfer rate, you may 
   weight them differently, even though they have the same capacity (e.g., 
   a weight of 0.80 for the first set of drives with lower total throughput, 
   and 1.20 for the second set of drives with higher total throughput).


.. _crushmaprules:

CRUSH Map Rules
---------------

CRUSH maps support the notion of 'CRUSH rules', which are the rules that
determine data placement for a pool. For large clusters, you will likely create
many pools where each pool may have its own CRUSH ruleset and rules. The default
CRUSH map has a rule for each pool, and one ruleset assigned to each of the
default pools, which include:

- ``data``
- ``metadata``
- ``rbd``

.. note:: In most cases, you will not need to modify the default rules. When
   you create a new pool, its default ruleset is ``0``.


CRUSH rules deﬁnes placement and replication strategies or distribution policies
that  allow you to specify exactly how CRUSH places object replicas. For
example, you might create a rule selecting a pair of targets for 2-way
mirroring, another rule for selecting three targets in two different data
centers for 3-way mirroring, and yet another rule for RAID-4 over six storage
devices. For a detailed discussion of CRUSH rules, refer to 
`CRUSH - Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data`_,
and more specifically to **Section 3.2**.

A rule takes the following form:: 

	rule <rulename> {
	
		ruleset <ruleset>
		type [ replicated | raid4 ]
		min_size <min-size>
		max_size <max-size>
		step take <bucket-type>
		step [choose|chooseleaf] [firstn|indep] <N> <bucket-type>
		step emit
	}


``ruleset``

:Description: Selects the number of buckets of the given type. The number is 
              usually the number of replicas in the pool (i.e., pool size). 

              - If ``{num} == 0``, choose ``pool-num-replicas`` buckets (all available).
              - If ``{num} > 0 && < pool-num-replicas``, choose that many buckets.
              - If ``{num} < 0``, it means ``pool-num-replicas - {num}``.

:Purpose: A component of the rule.
:Prerequisite: Follows ``step choose``.
:Example: ``step emit``

.. important:: To activate one or more rules with a common ruleset number to a 
   pool, set the ruleset number of the pool.



Primary Affinity
================

When a Ceph Client reads or writes data, it always contacts the primary OSD in
the acting set. For set ``[2, 3, 4]``, ``osd.2`` is the primary. Sometimes an
OSD isn't well suited to act as a primary compared to other OSDs (e.g., it has 
a slow disk or a slow controller). To prevent performance bottlenecks 
(especially on read operations) while maximizing utilization of your hardware,
you can set a Ceph OSD's primary affinity so that CRUSH is less likely to use 
the OSD as a primary in an acting set. ::

	ceph osd primary-affinity <osd-id> <weight>

Primary affinity is ``1`` by default (*i.e.,* an OSD may act as a primary). You
may set the OSD primary range from ``0-1``, where ``0`` means that the OSD may
**NOT** be used as a primary and ``1`` means that an OSD may be used as a
primary.  When the weight is ``< 1``, it is less likely that CRUSH will select
the Ceph OSD Daemon to act as a primary.


Placing Different Pools on Different OSDS:
==========================================

Suppose you want to have most pools default to OSDs backed by large hard drives,
but have some pools mapped to OSDs backed by fast solid-state drives (SSDs).
It's possible to have multiple independent CRUSH heirarchies within the same
CRUSH map. Define two hierarchies with two different root nodes--one for hard
disks (e.g., "root platter") and one for SSDs (e.g., "root ssd") as shown
below::

  device 0 osd.0
  device 1 osd.1
  device 2 osd.2
  device 3 osd.3
  device 4 osd.4
  device 5 osd.5
  device 6 osd.6
  device 7 osd.7

	host ceph-osd-ssd-server-1 {
		id -1
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item osd.0 weight 1.00
		item osd.1 weight 1.00
	}

	host ceph-osd-ssd-server-2 {
		id -2
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item osd.2 weight 1.00
		item osd.3 weight 1.00
	}

	host ceph-osd-platter-server-1 {
		id -3
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item osd.4 weight 1.00
		item osd.5 weight 1.00
	}

	host ceph-osd-platter-server-2 {
		id -4
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item osd.6 weight 1.00
		item osd.7 weight 1.00
	}

	root platter {
		id -5	
		alg straw
		hash 0
		item ceph-osd-platter-server-1 weight 2.00
		item ceph-osd-platter-server-2 weight 2.00
	}

	root ssd {
		id -6	
		alg straw

	}

You can then set a pool to use the SSD rule by::

  ceph osd pool set <poolname> crush_ruleset 4

Similarly, using the ``ssd-primary`` rule will cause each placement group in the
pool to be placed with an SSD as the primary and platters as the replicas.

Tunables
========

.. versionadded:: 0.48

There are several magic numbers that were used in the original CRUSH
implementation that have proven to be poor choices.  To support
the transition away from them, newer versions of CRUSH (starting with
the v0.48 argonaut series) allow the values to be adjusted or tuned.

Clusters running recent Ceph releases support using the tunable values
in the CRUSH maps.  However, older clients and daemons will not correctly interact
with clusters using the "tuned" CRUSH maps.  To detect this situation,
there are now features bits ``CRUSH_TUNABLES`` (value 0x40000) and ``CRUSH_TUNABLES2`` to
reflect support for tunables.

If the OSDMap currently used by the ``ceph-mon`` or ``ceph-osd``
daemon has non-legacy values, it will require the ``CRUSH_TUNABLES`` or ``CRUSH_TUNABLES2``
feature bits from clients and daemons who connect to it.  This means
that old clients will not be able to connect.

At some future point in time, newly created clusters will have
improved default values for the tunables.  This is a matter of waiting
until the support has been present in the Linux kernel clients long
enough to make this a painless transition for most users.

Impact of Legacy Values
-----------------------

The legacy values result in several misbehaviors:

 * For hiearchies with a small number of devices in the leaf buckets,
   some PGs map to fewer than the desired number of replicas.  This
   commonly happens for hiearchies with "host" nodes with a small
   number (1-3) of OSDs nested beneath each one.

 * For large clusters, some small percentages of PGs map to less than
   the desired number of OSDs.  This is more prevalent when there are
   several layers of the hierarchy (e.g., row, rack, host, osd).

 * When some OSDs are marked out, the data tends to get redistributed
   to nearby OSDs instead of across the entire hierarchy.

CRUSH_TUNABLES
--------------

 * ``choose_local_tries``: Number of local retries.  Legacy value is
   2, optimal value is 0.

 * ``choose_local_fallback_tries``: Legacy value is 5, optimal value
   is 0.

 * ``choose_total_tries``: Total number of attempts to choose an item.
   Legacy value was 19, subsequent testing indicates that a value of
   50 is more appropriate for typical clusters.  For extremely large
   clusters, a larger value might be necessary.

CRUSH_TUNABLES2
---------------

 * ``chooseleaf_descend_once``: Whether a recursive chooseleaf attempt
   will retry, or only try once and allow the original placement to
   retry.  Legacy default is 0, optimal value is 1.

CRUSH_TUNABLES3
---------------

 * ``chooseleaf_vary_r``: Whether a recursive chooseleaf attempt will
   start with a non-zero value of r, based on how many attempts the
   parent has already made.  Legacy default is 0, but with this value
   CRUSH is sometimes unable to find a mapping.  The optimal value (in
   terms of computational cost and correctness) is 1.  However, for
   legacy clusters that have lots of existing data, changing from 0 to
   1 will cause a lot of data to move; a value of 4 or 5 will allow
   CRUSH to find a valid mapping but will make less data move.


Which client versions support CRUSH_TUNABLES
--------------------------------------------

 * argonaut series, v0.48.1 or later
 * v0.49 or later
 * Linux kernel version v3.6 or later (for the file system and RBD kernel clients)

Which client versions support CRUSH_TUNABLES2
---------------------------------------------

 * v0.55 or later, including bobtail series (v0.56.x)
 * Linux kernel version v3.9 or later (for the file system and RBD kernel clients)

Which client versions support CRUSH_TUNABLES3
---------------------------------------------

 * v0.78 (firefly) or later
 * Linux kernel version v3.15 or later (for the file system and RBD kernel clients)

Warning when tunables are non-optimal
-------------------------------------

Starting with version v0.74, Ceph will issue a health warning if the
CRUSH tunables are not set to their optimal values (the optimal values are
the default as of v0.73).  To make this warning go away, you have two options:

1. Adjust the tunables on the existing cluster.  Note that this will
   result in some data movement (possibly as much as 10%).  This is the
   preferred route, but should be taken with care on a production cluster
   where the data movement may affect performance.  You can enable optimal
   tunables with::

      ceph osd crush tunables optimal

   If things go poorly (e.g., too much load) and not very much
   progress has been made, or there is a client compatibility problem
   (old kernel cephfs or rbd clients, or pre-bobtail librados
   clients), you can switch back with::

      ceph osd crush tunables legacy

2. You can make the warning go away without making any changes to CRUSH by
   adding the following option to your ceph.conf ``[mon]`` section::

      mon warn on legacy crush tunables = false

   For the change to take effect, you will need to restart the monitors, or
   apply the option to running monitors with::

      ceph -- tell mon.\* injectargs --no-mon-warn-on-legacy-crush-tunables


A few important points
----------------------

 * Adjusting these values will result in the shift of some PGs between
   storage nodes.  If the Ceph cluster is already storing a lot of
   data, be prepared for some fraction of the data to move.
 * The ``ceph-osd`` and ``ceph-mon`` daemons will start requiring the
   feature bits of new connections as soon as they get
   the updated map.  However, already-connected clients are
   effectively grandfathered in, and will misbehave if they do not
   support the new feature.
 * If the CRUSH tunables are set to non-legacy values and then later
   changed back to the defult values, ``ceph-osd`` daemons will not be
   required to support the feature.  However, the OSD peering process
   requires examining and understanding old maps.  Therefore, you
   should not run old versions of the ``ceph-osd`` daemon
   if the cluster has previously used non-legacy CRUSH values, even if
   the latest version of the map has been switched back to using the
   legacy defaults.

Tuning CRUSH
------------

The simplest way to adjust the crush tunables is by changing to a known
profile.  Those are:

 * ``legacy``: the legacy behavior from argonaut and earlier.
 * ``argonaut``: the legacy values supported by the original argonaut release
 * ``bobtail``: the values supported by the bobtail release
 * ``firefly``: the values supported by the firefly release
 * ``optimal``: the current best values
 * ``default``: the current default values for a new cluster

You can select a profile on a running cluster with the command::

 ceph osd crush tunables {PROFILE}

Note that this may result in some data movement.


Tuning CRUSH, the hard way
--------------------------

If you can ensure that all clients are running recent code, you can
adjust the tunables by extracting the CRUSH map, modifying the values,
and reinjecting it into the cluster.

* Extract the latest CRUSH map::

	ceph osd getcrushmap -o /tmp/crush

* Adjust tunables.  These values appear to offer the best behavior
  for both large and small clusters we tested with.  You will need to
  additionally specify the ``--enable-unsafe-tunables`` argument to
  ``crushtool`` for this to work.  Please use this option with
  extreme care.::

	crushtool -i /tmp/crush --set-choose-local-tries 0 --set-choose-local-fallback-tries 0 --set-choose-total-tries 50 -o /tmp/crush.new

* Reinject modified map::

	ceph osd setcrushmap -i /tmp/crush.new

Legacy values
-------------

For reference, the legacy values for the CRUSH tunables can be set
with::

   crushtool -i /tmp/crush --set-choose-local-tries 2 --set-choose-local-fallback-tries 5 --set-choose-total-tries 19 --set-chooseleaf-descend-once 0 --set-chooseleaf-vary-r 0 -o /tmp/crush.legacy

Again, the special ``--enable-unsafe-tunables`` option is required.
Further, as noted above, be careful running old versions of the
``ceph-osd`` daemon after reverting to legacy values as the feature
bit is not perfectly enforced.
