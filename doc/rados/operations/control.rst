.. index:: control, commands

==================
 Control Commands
==================


Monitor Commands
================

Monitor commands are issued using the ceph utility::

	ceph [-m monhost] {command}

The command is usually (though not always) of the form::

	ceph {subsystem} {command}


System Commands
===============

Execute the following to display the current status of the cluster.  ::

	ceph -s
	ceph status

Execute the following to display a running summary of the status of the cluster,
and major events. ::

	ceph -w

Execute the following to show the monitor quorum, including which monitors are
participating and which one is the leader. ::

	ceph quorum_status

Execute the following to query the status of a single monitor, including whether
or not it is in the quorum. ::

	ceph [-m monhost] mon_status


Authentication Subsystem
========================

To add a keyring for an OSD, execute the following::

	ceph auth add {osd} {--in-file|-i} {path-to-osd-keyring}

To list the cluster's keys and their capabilities, execute the following::

	ceph auth list


Placement Group Subsystem
=========================

To display the statistics for all placement groups, execute the following:: 

	ceph pg dump [--format {format}]

The valid formats are ``plain`` (default) and ``json``.

To display the statistics for all placement groups stuck in a specified state, 
execute the following:: 

	ceph pg dump_stuck inactive|unclean|stale [--format {format}] [-t|--threshold {seconds}]


``--format`` may be ``plain`` (default) or ``json``

``--threshold`` defines how many seconds "stuck" is (default: 300)

**Inactive** Placement groups cannot process reads or writes because they are waiting for an OSD
with the most up-to-date data to come back.

**Unclean** Placement groups contain objects that are not replicated the desired number
of times. They should be recovering.

**Stale** Placement groups are in an unknown state - the OSDs that host them have not
reported to the monitor cluster in a while (configured by
``mon_osd_report_timeout``).

Delete "lost" objects or revert them to their prior state, either a previous version
or delete them if they were just created. ::

	ceph pg {pgid} mark_unfound_lost revert|delete


OSD Subsystem
=============

Query OSD subsystem status. ::

	ceph osd stat

Write a copy of the most recent OSD map to a file. See
`osdmaptool`_. ::

	ceph osd getmap -o file

.. _osdmaptool: ../../man/8/osdmaptool

Write a copy of the crush map from the most recent OSD map to
file. ::

	ceph osd getcrushmap -o file

The foregoing functionally equivalent to ::

	ceph osd getmap -o /tmp/osdmap
	osdmaptool /tmp/osdmap --export-crush file

Dump the OSD map. Valid formats for ``-f`` are ``plain`` and ``json``. If no
``--format`` option is given, the OSD map is dumped as plain text. ::

	ceph osd dump [--format {format}]

Dump the OSD map as a tree with one line per OSD containing weight
and state. ::

	ceph osd tree [--format {format}]

Find out where a specific object is or would be stored in the system::

	ceph osd map <pool-name> <object-name>

Add or move a new item (OSD) with the given id/name/weight at the specified
location. ::

	ceph osd crush set {id} {weight} [{loc1} [{loc2} ...]]

Remove an existing item from the CRUSH map. ::

	ceph osd crush remove {id}

Move an existing bucket from one position in the hierarchy to another.  ::

   ceph osd crush move {id} {loc1} [{loc2} ...]

Set the weight of the item given by ``{name}`` to ``{weight}``. ::

	ceph osd crush reweight {name} {weight}

Create a cluster snapshot. ::

	ceph osd cluster_snap {name}

Mark an OSD as lost. This may result in permanent data loss. Use with caution. ::

	ceph osd lost {id} [--yes-i-really-mean-it]

Create a new OSD. If no UUID is given, it will be set automatically when the OSD
starts up. ::

	ceph osd create [{uuid}]

Remove the given OSD(s). ::

	ceph osd rm [{id}...]

Query the current max_osd parameter in the OSD map. ::

	ceph osd getmaxosd

Import the given OSD map. Note that this can be a bit dangerous,
since the OSD map includes dynamic state about which OSDs are current
on or offline; only do this if you've just modified a (very) recent
copy of the map. ::

	ceph osd setmap -i file

Import the given crush map. ::

	ceph osd setcrushmap -i file

Set the ``max_osd`` parameter in the OSD map. This is necessary when
expanding the storage cluster. ::

	ceph osd setmaxosd

Mark OSD ``{osd-num}`` down. ::

	ceph osd down {osd-num}

Mark OSD ``{osd-num}`` out of the distribution (i.e. allocated no data). ::

	ceph osd out {osd-num}

Mark ``{osd-num}`` in the distribution (i.e. allocated data). ::

	ceph osd in {osd-num}

List classes that are loaded in the ceph cluster. ::

	ceph class list

Set or clear the pause flags in the OSD map. If set, no IO requests
will be sent to any OSD. Clearing the flags via unpause results in
resending pending requests. ::

	ceph osd pause
	ceph osd unpause

Set the weight of ``{osd-num}`` to ``{weight}``. Two OSDs with the
same weight will receive roughly the same number of I/O requests and
store approximately the same amount of data. ``ceph osd reweight``
sets an override weight on the OSD. This value is in the range 0 to 1,
and forces CRUSH to re-place (1-weight) of the data that would
otherwise live on this drive. It does not change the weights assigned
to the buckets above the OSD in the crush map, and is a corrective
measure in case the normal CRUSH distribution isn't working out quite
right. For instance, if one of your OSDs is at 90% and the others are
at 50%, you could reduce this weight to try and compensate for it. ::

	ceph osd reweight {osd-num} {weight}

Reweights all the OSDs by reducing the weight of OSDs which are
heavily overused. By default it will adjust the weights downward on
OSDs which have 120% of the average utilization, but if you include
threshold it will use that percentage instead. ::

	ceph osd reweight-by-utilization [threshold]

Adds/removes the address to/from the blacklist. When adding an address,
you can specify how long it should be blacklisted in seconds; otherwise,
it will default to 1 hour. A blacklisted address is prevented from
connecting to any OSD. Blacklisting is most often used to prevent a
lagging metadata server from making bad changes to data on the OSDs.

These commands are mostly only useful for failure testing, as
blacklists are normally maintained automatically and shouldn't need
manual intervention. ::

	ceph osd blacklist add ADDRESS[:source_port] [TIME]
	ceph osd blacklist rm ADDRESS[:source_port]

Creates/deletes a snapshot of a pool. ::

	ceph osd pool mksnap {pool-name} {snap-name}
	ceph osd pool rmsnap {pool-name} {snap-name}

Creates/deletes/renames a storage pool. ::

	ceph osd pool create {pool-name} pg_num [pgp_num]
	ceph osd pool delete {pool-name} [{pool-name} --yes-i-really-really-mean-it]
	ceph osd pool rename {old-name} {new-name}

Changes a pool setting. :: 

	ceph osd pool set {pool-name} {field} {value}

Valid fields are:

	* ``size``: Sets the number of copies of data in the pool.
	* ``crash_replay_interval``: The number of seconds to allow
	  clients to replay acknowledged but uncommited requests.
	* ``pg_num``: The placement group number.
	* ``pgp_num``: Effective number when calculating pg placement.
	* ``crush_ruleset``: rule number for mapping placement.

Get the value of a pool setting. ::

	ceph osd pool get {pool-name} {field}

Valid fields are:

	* ``pg_num``: The placement group number.
	* ``pgp_num``: Effective number of placement groups when calculating placement.
	* ``lpg_num``: The number of local placement groups.
	* ``lpgp_num``: The number used for placing the local placement groups.


Sends a scrub command to OSD ``{osd-num}``. To send the command to all OSDs, use ``*``. ::

	ceph osd scrub {osd-num}

Sends a repair command to OSD.N. To send the command to all OSDs, use ``*``. ::

	ceph osd repair N

Runs a simple throughput benchmark against OSD.N, writing ``NUMBER_OF_OBJECTS``
in write requests of ``BYTES_PER_WRITE`` each. By default, the test
writes 1 GB in total in 4-MB increments. ::

	ceph tell osd.N bench [NUMER_OF_OBJECTS] [BYTES_PER_WRITE]


MDS Subsystem
=============

Change configuration parameters on a running mds. ::

	ceph mds tell {mds-id} injectargs '--{switch} {value} [--{switch} {value}]'

Example::

	ceph mds tell 0 injectargs '--debug_ms 1 --debug_mds 10'

Enables debug messages. ::

	ceph mds stat

Displays the status of all metadata servers.

	ceph mds fail 0

Marks the active MDS as failed, triggering failover to a standby if present.

.. todo:: ``ceph mds`` subcommands missing docs: set, dump, getmap, stop, setmap


Mon Subsystem
=============

Show monitor stats::

	ceph mon stat
	
	2011-12-14 10:40:59.044395 mon {- [mon,stat]
	2011-12-14 10:40:59.057111 mon.1 -} 'e3: 5 mons at {a=10.1.2.3:6789/0,b=10.1.2.4:6789/0,c=10.1.2.5:6789/0,d=10.1.2.6:6789/0,e=10.1.2.7:6789/0}, election epoch 16, quorum 0,1,2,3' (0)

The ``quorum`` list at the end lists monitor nodes that are part of the current quorum.

This is also available more directly::

	$ ./ceph quorum_status
	
	2011-12-14 10:44:20.417705 mon {- [quorum_status]
	2011-12-14 10:44:20.431890 mon.0 -} 

.. code-block:: javascript	
	
	'{ "election_epoch": 10,	
	  "quorum": [
	        0,
	        1,
	        2],
	  "monmap": { "epoch": 1,
	      "fsid": "444b489c-4f16-4b75-83f0-cb8097468898",
	      "modified": "2011-12-12 13:28:27.505520",
	      "created": "2011-12-12 13:28:27.505520",
	      "mons": [
	            { "rank": 0,
	              "name": "a",
	              "addr": "127.0.0.1:6789\/0"},
	            { "rank": 1,
	              "name": "b",
	              "addr": "127.0.0.1:6790\/0"},
	            { "rank": 2,
	              "name": "c",
	              "addr": "127.0.0.1:6791\/0"}]}}' (0)

The above will block until a quorum is reached.

For a status of just the monitor you connect to (use ``-m HOST:PORT``
to select)::

	ceph mon_status
	
	
	2011-12-14 10:45:30.644414 mon {- [mon_status]
	2011-12-14 10:45:30.644632 mon.0 -} 

.. code-block:: javascript
	
	'{ "name": "a",
	  "rank": 0,
	  "state": "leader",
	  "election_epoch": 10,
	  "quorum": [
	        0,
	        1,
	        2],
	  "outside_quorum": [],
	  "monmap": { "epoch": 1,
	      "fsid": "444b489c-4f16-4b75-83f0-cb8097468898",
	      "modified": "2011-12-12 13:28:27.505520",
	      "created": "2011-12-12 13:28:27.505520",
	      "mons": [
	            { "rank": 0,
	              "name": "a",
	              "addr": "127.0.0.1:6789\/0"},
	            { "rank": 1,
	              "name": "b",
	              "addr": "127.0.0.1:6790\/0"},
	            { "rank": 2,
	              "name": "c",
	              "addr": "127.0.0.1:6791\/0"}]}}' (0)
