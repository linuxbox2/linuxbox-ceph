 Release Notes

v0.85
=====

This is the second-to-last development release before Giant that
contains new functionality.  The big items to land during this cycle
are the messenger refactoring from Matt Benjmain that lays some
groundwork for RDMA support, a performance improvement series from
SanDisk that improves performance on SSDs, lots of improvements to our
new standalone civetweb-based RGW frontend, and a new 'osd blocked-by'
mon command that allows admins to easily identify which OSDs are
blocking peering progress.  The other big change is that the OSDs and
Monitors now distinguish between "misplaced" and "degraded" objects:
the latter means there are fewer copies than we'd like, while the
former simply means the are not stored in the locations where we want
them to be.

Also of note is a change to librbd that enables client-side caching by
default.  This is coupled with another option that makes the cache
write-through until a "flush" operations is observed: this implies
that the librbd user (usually a VM guest OS) supports barriers and
flush and that it is safe for the cache to switch into writeback mode
without compromising data safety or integrity.  It has long been
recommended practice that these options be enabled (e.g., in OpenStack
environments) but until now it has not been the default.

We have frozen the tree for the looming Giant release, and the next
development release will be a release candidate with a final batch of
new functionality.

Upgrading
---------

* The client-side caching for librbd is now enabled by default (rbd
  cache = true).  A safety option (rbd cache writethrough until flush
  = true) is also enabled so that writeback caching is not used until
  the library observes a 'flush' command, indicating that the librbd
  users is passing that operation through from the guest VM.  This
  avoids potential data loss when used with older versions of qemu
  that do not support flush.

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 32*1024*1024  = 33554432  // 32MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""

* The 'rados getxattr ...' command used to add a gratuitous newline to the attr
  value; it now does not.

v0.84
=====

The next Ceph development release is here!  This release contains
several meaty items, including some MDS improvements for journaling,
the ability to remove the CephFS file system (and name it), several
mon cleanups with tiered pools, several OSD performance branches, a
new "read forward" RADOS caching mode, a prototype Kinetic OSD
backend, and various radosgw improvements (especially with the new
standalone civetweb frontend).  And there are a zillion OSD bug
fixes. Things are looking pretty good for the Giant release that is
coming up in the next month.

Upgrading
---------

* The ``*_kb perf`` counters on the monitor have been removed.  These are
  replaced with a new set of ``*_bytes`` counters (e.g., ``cluster_osd_kb`` is
  replaced by ``cluster_osd_bytes``).

* The ``rd_kb`` and ``wr_kb`` fields in the JSON dumps for pool stats (accessed
  via the ``ceph df detail -f json-pretty`` and related commands) have been 
  replaced with corresponding ``*_bytes`` fields.  Similarly, the 
  ``total_space``, ``total_used``, and ``total_avail`` fields are replaced with 
  ``total_bytes``, ``total_used_bytes``,  and ``total_avail_bytes`` fields.
  
* The ``rados df --format=json`` output ``read_bytes`` and ``write_bytes``
  fields were incorrectly reporting ops; this is now fixed.

* The ``rados df --format=json`` output previously included ``read_kb`` and
  ``write_kb`` fields; these have been removed.  Please use ``read_bytes`` and
  ``write_bytes`` instead (and divide by 1024 if appropriate).

v0.83
=====

Another Ceph development release!  This has been a longer cycle, so
there has been quite a bit of bug fixing and stabilization in this
round.  There is also a bunch of packaging fixes for RPM distros
(RHEL/CentOS, Fedora, and SUSE) and for systemd.  We've also added a new
librados-striper library from Sebastien Ponce that provides a generic
striping API for applications to code to.

Upgrading
---------

* The experimental keyvaluestore-dev OSD backend had an on-disk format
  change that prevents existing OSD data from being upgraded.  This
  affects developers and testers only.

* mon-specific and osd-specific leveldb options have been removed.
  From this point onward users should use the `leveldb_*` generic
  options and add the options in the appropriate sections of their
  configuration files.  Monitors will still maintain the following
  monitor-specific defaults:

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 32*1024*1024  = 33554432  // 32MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""

v0.81
=====

This is the first development release since Firefly.  It includes a
lot of work that we delayed merging while stabilizing things.  Lots of
new functionality, as well as several fixes that are baking a bit before
getting backported.

Upgrading
---------

* CephFS support for the legacy anchor table has finally been removed.
  Users with file systems created before firefly should ensure that inodes
  with multiple hard links are modified *prior* to the upgrade to ensure that
  the backtraces are written properly.  For example::

    sudo find /mnt/cephfs -type f -links +1 -exec touch \{\} \;

* Disallow nonsensical 'tier cache-mode' transitions.  From this point
  onward, 'writeback' can only transition to 'forward' and 'forward'
  can transition to 1) 'writeback' if there are dirty objects, or 2) any if
  there are no dirty objects.

v0.80.5 Firefly
===============

This release fixes a few important bugs in the radosgw and fixes
several packaging and environment issues, including OSD log rotation,
systemd environments, and daemon restarts on upgrade.

We recommend that all v0.80.x Firefly users upgrade, particularly if they
are using upstart, systemd, or radosgw.

Notable Changes
---------------

* ceph-dencoder: do not needlessly link to librgw, librados, etc. (Sage Weil)
* do not needlessly link binaries to leveldb (Sage Weil)
* mon: fix mon crash when no auth keys are present (#8851, Joao Eduardo Luis)
* osd: fix cleanup (and avoid occasional crash) during shutdown (#7981, Sage Weil)
* osd: fix log rotation under upstart (Sage Weil)
* rgw: fix multipart upload when object has irregular size (#8846, Yehuda Sadeh, Sylvain Munaut)
* rgw: improve bucket listing S3 compatibility (#8858, Yehuda Sadeh)
* rgw: improve delimited bucket listing (Yehuda Sadeh)
* rpm: do not restart daemons on upgrade (#8849, Alfredo Deza)

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.80.5.txt>`.

v0.80.4 Firefly
===============

This Firefly point release fixes an potential data corruption problem
when ceph-osd daemons run on top of XFS and service Firefly librbd
clients.  A recently added allocation hint that RBD utilizes triggers
an XFS bug on some kernels (Linux 3.2, and likely others) that leads
to data corruption and deep-scrub errors (and inconsistent PGs).  This
release avoids the situation by disabling the allocation hint until we
can validate which kernels are affected and/or are known to be safe to
use the hint on.

We recommend that all v0.80.x Firefly users urgently upgrade,
especially if they are using RBD.

Notable Changes
---------------

* osd: disable XFS extsize hint by default (#8830, Samuel Just)
* rgw: fix extra data pool default name (Yehuda Sadeh)

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.80.4.txt>`.


v0.80.3 Firefly
===============

This is the third Firefly point release.  It includes a single fix
for a radosgw regression that was discovered in v0.80.2 right after it
was released.

We recommand that all v0.80.x Firefly users upgrade.

Notable Changes
---------------

* radosgw: fix regression in manifest decoding (#8804, Sage Weil)

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.80.3.txt>`.


v0.80.2 Firefly
===============

This is the second Firefly point release.  It contains a range of
important fixes, including several bugs in the OSD cache tiering, some
compatibility checks that affect upgrade situations, several radosgw
bugs, and an irritating and unnecessary feature bit check that
prevents older clients from communicating with a cluster with any
erasure coded pools.

One someone large change in this point release is that the ceph RPM
package is separated into a ceph and ceph-common package, similar to
Debian.  The ceph-common package contains just the client libraries
without any of the server-side daemons.

We recommend that all v0.80.x Firefly users skip this release and use
v0.80.3.

v0.80 Firefly
=============

This release will form the basis for our long-term supported release
Firefly, v0.80.x.  The big new features are support for erasure coding
and cache tiering, although a broad range of other features, fixes,
and improvements have been made across the code base.  Highlights include:

* *Erasure coding*: support for a broad range of erasure codes for lower
  storage overhead and better data durability.
* *Cache tiering*: support for creating 'cache pools' that store hot,
  recently accessed objects with automatic demotion of colder data to
  a base tier.  Typically the cache pool is backed by faster storage
  devices like SSDs.
* *Primary affinity*: Ceph now has the ability to skew selection of
  OSDs as the "primary" copy, which allows the read workload to be
  cheaply skewed away from parts of the cluster without migrating any
  data.
* *Key/value OSD backend* (experimental): An alternative storage backend
  for Ceph OSD processes that puts all data in a key/value database like
  leveldb.  This provides better performance for workloads dominated by
  key/value operations (like radosgw bucket indices).
* *Standalone radosgw* (experimental): The radosgw process can now run
  in a standalone mode without an apache (or similar) web server or
  fastcgi.  This simplifies deployment and can improve performance.

We expect to maintain a series of stable releases based on v0.80
Firefly for as much as a year.  In the meantime, development of Ceph
continues with the next release, Giant, which will feature work on the
CephFS distributed file system, more alternative storage backends
(like RocksDB and f2fs), RDMA support, support for pyramid erasure
codes, and additional functionality in the block device (RBD) like
copy-on-read and multisite mirroring.


Upgrade Sequencing
------------------

* If your existing cluster is running a version older than v0.67
  Dumpling, please first upgrade to the latest Dumpling release before
  upgrading to v0.80 Firefly.  Please refer to the `Dumpling upgrade`_
  documentation.

* We recommand adding the following to the [mon] section of your
  ceph.conf prior to upgrade::

    mon warn on legacy crush tunables = false

  This will prevent health warnings due to the use of legacy CRUSH
  placement.  Although it is possible to rebalance existing data
  across your cluster (see the upgrade notes below), we do not
  normally recommend it for production environments as a large amount
  of data will move and there is a significant performance impact from
  the rebalancing.

* Upgrade daemons in the following order:

    #. Monitors
    #. OSDs
    #. MDSs and/or radosgw

  If the ceph-mds daemon is restarted first, it will wait until all
  OSDs have been upgraded before finishing its startup sequence.  If
  the ceph-mon daemons are not restarted prior to the ceph-osd
  daemons, they will not correctly register their new capabilities
  with the cluster and new features may not be usable until they are
  restarted a second time.

* Upgrade radosgw daemons together.  There is a subtle change in behavior
  for multipart uploads that prevents a multipart request that was initiated
  with a new radosgw from being completed by an old radosgw.


Upgrading from v0.79
--------------------

* OSDMap's json-formatted dump changed for keys 'full' and 'nearfull'.
  What was previously being outputted as 'true' or 'false' strings are
  now being outputted 'true' and 'false' booleans according to json syntax.

* HEALTH_WARN on 'mon osd down out interval == 0'. Having this option set
  to zero on the leader acts much like having the 'noout' flag set.  This
  warning will only be reported if the monitor getting the 'health' or
  'status' request has this option set to zero.

* Monitor 'auth' commands now require the mon 'x' capability.  This matches
  dumpling v0.67.x and earlier, but differs from emperor v0.72.x.

* A librados WATCH operation on a non-existent object now returns ENOENT;
  previously it did not.

* Librados interface change:  As there are no partial writes, the rados_write()
  and rados_append() operations now return 0 on success like rados_write_full()
  always has.  This includes the C++ interface equivalents and AIO return
  values for the aio variants.

* The radosgw init script (sysvinit) how requires that the 'host = ...' line in
  ceph.conf, if present, match the short hostname (the output of 'hostname -s'),
  not the fully qualified hostname or the (occasionally non-short) output of
  'hostname'.  Failure to adjust this when upgrading from emperor or dumpling
  may prevent the radosgw daemon from starting.

Upgrading from v0.72 Emperor
----------------------------

* See notes above.

* The 'ceph -s' or 'ceph status' command's 'num_in_osds' field in the
  JSON and XML output has been changed from a string to an int.

* The recently added 'ceph mds set allow_new_snaps' command's syntax
  has changed slightly; it is now 'ceph mds set allow_new_snaps true'.
  The 'unset' command has been removed; instead, set the value to
  'false'.

* The syntax for allowing snapshots is now 'mds set allow_new_snaps
  <true|false>' instead of 'mds <set,unset> allow_new_snaps'.

* 'rbd ls' on a pool which never held rbd images now exits with code
  0. It outputs nothing in plain format, or an empty list in
  non-plain format. This is consistent with the behavior for a pool
  which used to hold images, but contains none. Scripts relying on
  this behavior should be updated.

* The MDS requires a new OSD operation TMAP2OMAP, added in this release.  When
  upgrading, be sure to upgrade and restart the ceph-osd daemons before the
  ceph-mds daemon.  The MDS will refuse to start if any up OSDs do not support
  the new feature.

* The 'ceph mds set_max_mds N' command is now deprecated in favor of
  'ceph mds set max_mds N'.

* The 'osd pool create ...' syntax has changed for erasure pools.

* The default CRUSH rules and layouts are now using the 'bobtail'
  tunables and defaults.  Upgaded clusters using the old values will
  now present with a health WARN state.  This can be disabled by
  adding 'mon warn on legacy crush tunables = false' to ceph.conf and
  restarting the monitors.  Alternatively, you can switch to the new
  tunables with 'ceph osd crush tunables firefly,' but keep in mind
  that this will involve moving a *significant* portion of the data
  already stored in the cluster and in a large cluster may take
  several days to complete.  We do not recommend adjusting tunables on a
  production cluster.

* We now default to the 'bobtail' CRUSH tunable values that are first supported
  by Ceph clients in bobtail (v0.56) and Linux kernel version v3.9.  If you
  plan to access a newly created Ceph cluster with an older kernel client, you
  should use 'ceph osd crush tunables legacy' to switch back to the legacy
  behavior.  Note that making that change will likely result in some data
  movement in the system, so adjust the setting before populating the new
  cluster with data.

* We now set the HASHPSPOOL flag on newly created pools (and new
  clusters) by default.  Support for this flag first appeared in
  v0.64; v0.67 Dumpling is the first major release that supports it.
  It is first supported by the Linux kernel version v3.9.  If you plan
  to access a newly created Ceph cluster with an older kernel or
  clients (e.g, librados, librbd) from a pre-dumpling Ceph release,
  you should add 'osd pool default flag hashpspool = false' to the
  '[global]' section of your 'ceph.conf' prior to creating your
  monitors (e.g., after 'ceph-deploy new' but before 'ceph-deploy mon
  create ...').

* The configuration option 'osd pool default crush rule' is deprecated
  and replaced with 'osd pool default crush replicated ruleset'. 'osd
  pool default crush rule' takes precedence for backward compatibility
  and a deprecation warning is displayed when it is used.

* As part of fix for #6796, 'ceph osd pool set <pool> <var> <arg>' now
  receives <arg> as an integer instead of a string.  This affects how
  'hashpspool' flag is set/unset: instead of 'true' or 'false', it now
  must be '0' or '1'.

* The behavior of the CRUSH 'indep' choose mode has been changed.  No
  ceph cluster should have been using this behavior unless someone has
  manually extracted a crush map, modified a CRUSH rule to replace
  'firstn' with 'indep', recompiled, and reinjected the new map into
  the cluster.  If the 'indep' mode is currently in use on a cluster,
  the rule should be modified to use 'firstn' instead, and the
  administrator should wait until any data movement completes before
  upgrading.

* The 'osd dump' command now dumps pool snaps as an array instead of an
  object.


Upgrading from v0.67 Dumpling
-----------------------------

* See notes above.

* ceph-fuse and radosgw now use the same default values for the admin
  socket and log file paths that the other daemons (ceph-osd,
  ceph-mon, etc.) do.  If you run these daemons as non-root, you may
  need to adjust your ceph.conf to disable these options or to adjust
  the permissions on /var/run/ceph and /var/log/ceph.

* The MDS now disallows snapshots by default as they are not
  considered stable.  The command 'ceph mds set allow_snaps' will
  enable them.

* For clusters that were created before v0.44 (pre-argonaut, Spring
  2012) and store radosgw data, the auto-upgrade from TMAP to OMAP
  objects has been disabled.  Before upgrading, make sure that any
  buckets created on pre-argonaut releases have been modified (e.g.,
  by PUTing and then DELETEing an object from each bucket).  Any
  cluster created with argonaut (v0.48) or a later release or not
  using radosgw never relied on the automatic conversion and is not
  affected by this change.

* Any direct users of the 'tmap' portion of the librados API should be
  aware that the automatic tmap -> omap conversion functionality has
  been removed.

* Most output that used K or KB (e.g., for kilobyte) now uses a
  lower-case k to match the official SI convention.  Any scripts that
  parse output and check for an upper-case K will need to be modified.

* librados::Rados::pool_create_async() and librados::Rados::pool_delete_async()
  don't drop a reference to the completion object on error, caller needs to take
  care of that. This has never really worked correctly and we were leaking an
  object

* 'ceph osd crush set <id> <weight> <loc..>' no longer adds the osd to the
  specified location, as that's a job for 'ceph osd crush add'.  It will
  however continue to work just the same as long as the osd already exists
  in the crush map.

* The OSD now enforces that class write methods cannot both mutate an
  object and return data.  The rbd.assign_bid method, the lone
  offender, has been removed.  This breaks compatibility with
  pre-bobtail librbd clients by preventing them from creating new
  images.

* librados now returns on commit instead of ack for synchronous calls.
  This is a bit safer in the case where both OSDs and the client crash, and
  is probably how it should have been acting from the beginning. Users are
  unlikely to notice but it could result in lower performance in some
  circumstances. Those who care should switch to using the async interfaces,
  which let you specify safety semantics precisely.

* The C++ librados AioComplete::get_version() method was incorrectly
  returning an int (usually 32-bits).  To avoid breaking library
  compatibility, a get_version64() method is added that returns the
  full-width value.  The old method is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release.  Users of the C++ librados API that make use of
  the get_version() method should modify their code to avoid getting a
  value that is truncated from 64 to to 32 bits.

v0.79
=====

This release is intended to serve as a release candidate for firefly,
which will hopefully be v0.80.  No changes are being made to the code
base at this point except those that fix bugs.  Please test this
release if you intend to make use of the new erasure-coded pools or
cache tiers in firefly.

This release fixes a range of bugs found in v0.78 and streamlines the
user experience when creating erasure-coded pools.  There is also a
raft of fixes for the MDS (multi-mds, directory fragmentation, and
large directories).  The main notable new piece of functionality is a
small change to allow radosgw to use an erasure-coded pool for object
data.


Upgrading
---------
* Erasure pools created with v0.78 will no longer function with v0.79.  You
  will need to delete the old pool and create a new one.

* A bug was fixed in the authentication handshake with big-endian
  architectures that prevent authentication between big- and
  little-endian machines in the same cluster.  If you have a cluster
  that consists entirely of big-endian machines, you will need to
  upgrade all daemons and clients and restart.

* The 'ceph.file.layout' and 'ceph.dir.layout' extended attributes are
  no longer included in the listxattr(2) results to prevent problems with
  'cp -a' and similar tools.

* Monitor 'auth' read-only commands now expect the user to have 'rx' caps.
  This is the same behavior that was present in dumpling, but in emperor
  and more recent development releases the 'r' cap was sufficient.  The
  affected commands are::

    ceph auth export
    ceph auth get
    ceph auth get-key
    ceph auth print-key
    ceph auth list

Notable Changes
---------------
* ceph-conf: stop creating bogus log files (Josh Durgin, Sage Weil)
* common: fix authentication on big-endian architectures (Dan Mick)
* debian: change directory ownership between ceph and ceph-common (Sage Weil)
* init: fix startup ordering/timeout problem with OSDs (Dmitry Smirnov)
* librbd: skip zeroes/holes when copying sparse images (Josh Durgin)

* osd: reduce scrub lock contention (Guang Yang)
* rgw: allow use of an erasure data pool (Yehuda Sadeh)


v0.78
=====

This development release includes two key features: erasure coding and
cache tiering.  A huge amount of code was merged for this release and
several additional weeks were spent stabilizing the code base, and it
is now in a state where it is ready to be tested by a broader user
base.

This is *not* the firefly release.  Firefly will be delayed for at
least another sprint so that we can get some operational experience
with the new code and do some additional testing before committing to
long term support.

.. note:: Please note that while it is possible to create and test
          erasure coded pools in this release, the pools will not be
          usable when you upgrade to v0.79 as the OSDMap encoding will
          subtlely change.  Please do not populate your test pools
          with important data that can't be reloaded.

Upgrading
---------

* Upgrade daemons in the following order:

    #. Monitors
    #. OSDs
    #. MDSs and/or radosgw

  If the ceph-mds daemon is restarted first, it will wait until all
  OSDs have been upgraded before finishing its startup sequence.  If
  the ceph-mon daemons are not restarted prior to the ceph-osd
  daemons, they will not correctly register their new capabilities
  with the cluster and new features may not be usable until they are
  restarted a second time.

* Upgrade radosgw daemons together.  There is a subtle change in behavior
  for multipart uploads that prevents a multipart request that was initiated
  with a new radosgw from being completed by an old radosgw.

* CephFS recently added support for a new 'backtrace' attribute on
  file data objects that is used for lookup by inode number (i.e., NFS
  reexport and hard links), and will later be used by fsck repair.
  This replaces the existing anchor table mechanism that is used for
  hard link resolution.  In order to completely phase that out, any
  inode that has an outdated backtrace attribute will get updated when
  the inode itself is modified.  This will result in some extra workload
  after a legacy CephFS file system is upgraded.

* The per-op return code in librados' ObjectWriteOperation interface
  is now filled in.

* The librados cmpxattr operation now handles xattrs containing null bytes as
  data rather than null-terminated strings.

* Compound operations in librados that create and then delete the same object
  are now explicitly disallowed (they fail with -EINVAL).

* The default leveldb cache size for the ceph-osd daemon has been
  increased from 4 MB to 128 MB.  This will increase the memory
  footprint of that process but tends to increase performance of omap
  (key/value) objects (used for CephFS and the radosgw).  If memory in your
  deployment is tight, you can preserve the old behavio by adding::

    leveldb write buffer size = 0
    leveldb cache size = 0

  to your ceph.conf to get back the (leveldb) defaults.

Notable Changes
---------------
* ceph-brag: new client and server tools (Sebastien Han, Babu Shanmugam)
* ceph-disk: use partx on RHEL or CentOS instead of partprobe (Alfredo Deza)

v0.77
=====

This is the final development release before the Firefly feature
freeze.  The main items in this release include some additional
refactoring work in the OSD IO path (include some locking
improvements), per-user quotas for the radosgw, a switch to civetweb
from mongoose for the prototype radosgw standalone mode, and a
prototype leveldb-based backend for the OSD.  The C librados API also
got support for atomic write operations (read side transactions will
appear in v0.78).

Upgrading
---------

* The 'ceph -s' or 'ceph status' command's 'num_in_osds' field in the
  JSON and XML output has been changed from a string to an int.

* The recently added 'ceph mds set allow_new_snaps' command's syntax
  has changed slightly; it is now 'ceph mds set allow_new_snaps true'.
  The 'unset' command has been removed; instead, set the value to
  'false'.

* The syntax for allowing snapshots is now 'mds set allow_new_snaps
  <true|false>' instead of 'mds <set,unset> allow_new_snaps'.

Notable Changes
---------------

* osd: client IO path changes for EC (Samuel Just)
* common: portability changes to support libc++ (Noah Watkins)
* common: switch to unordered_map from hash_map (Noah Watkins)

* mon: change mds allow_new_snaps syntax to be more consistent (Sage Weil)


v0.76
=====

This release includes another batch of updates for firefly
functionality.  Most notably, the cache pool infrastructure now
support snapshots, the OSD backfill functionality has been generalized
to include multiple targets (necessary for the coming erasure pools),
and there were performance improvements to the erasure code plugin on
capable processors.  The MDS now properly utilizes (and seamlessly
migrates to) the OSD key/value interface (aka omap) for storing directory
objects.  There continue to be many other fixes and improvements for
usability and code portability across the tree.

Upgrading
---------

* 'rbd ls' on a pool which never held rbd images now exits with code
  0. It outputs nothing in plain format, or an empty list in
  non-plain format. This is consistent with the behavior for a pool
  which used to hold images, but contains none. Scripts relying on
  this behavior should be updated.

* The MDS requires a new OSD operation TMAP2OMAP, added in this release.  When
  upgrading, be sure to upgrade and restart the ceph-osd daemons before the
  ceph-mds daemon.  The MDS will refuse to start if any up OSDs do not support
  the new feature.

* The 'ceph mds set_max_mds N' command is now deprecated in favor of
  'ceph mds set max_mds N'.

v0.75
=====

This is a big release, with lots of infrastructure going in for
firefly.  The big items include a prototype standalone frontend for
radosgw (which does not require apache or fastcgi), tracking for read
activity on the osds (to inform tiering decisions), preliminary cache
pool support (no snapshots yet), and lots of bug fixes and other work
across the tree to get ready for the next batch of erasure coding
patches.

For comparison, here are the diff stats for the last few versions::

 v0.75 291 files changed, 82713 insertions(+), 33495 deletions(-)
 v0.74 192 files changed, 17980 insertions(+), 1062 deletions(-)
 v0.73 148 files changed, 4464 insertions(+), 2129 deletions(-)

Upgrading
---------

- The 'osd pool create ...' syntax has changed for erasure pools.

- The default CRUSH rules and layouts are now using the latest and
  greatest tunables and defaults.  Clusters using the old values will
  now present with a health WARN state.  This can be disabled by
  adding 'mon warn on legacy crush tunables = false' to ceph.conf.

v0.74
=====

This release includes a few substantial pieces for Firefly, including
a long-overdue switch to 3x replication by default and a switch to the
"new" CRUSH tunables by default (supported since bobtail).  There is
also a fix for a long-standing radosgw bug (stalled GET) that has
already been backported to emperor and dumpling.

Upgrading
---------

* We now default to the 'bobtail' CRUSH tunable values that are first supported
  by Ceph clients in bobtail (v0.56) and Linux kernel version v3.9.  If you
  plan to access a newly created Ceph cluster with an older kernel client, you
  should use 'ceph osd crush tunables legacy' to switch back to the legacy
  behavior.  Note that making that change will likely result in some data
  movement in the system, so adjust the setting before populating the new
  cluster with data.

* We now set the HASHPSPOOL flag on newly created pools (and new
  clusters) by default.  Support for this flag first appeared in
  v0.64; v0.67 Dumpling is the first major release that supports it.
  It is first supported by the Linux kernel version v3.9.  If you plan
  to access a newly created Ceph cluster with an older kernel or
  clients (e.g, librados, librbd) from a pre-dumpling Ceph release,
  you should add 'osd pool default flag hashpspool = false' to the
  '[global]' section of your 'ceph.conf' prior to creating your
  monitors (e.g., after 'ceph-deploy new' but before 'ceph-deploy mon
  create ...').

* The configuration option 'osd pool default crush rule' is deprecated
  and replaced with 'osd pool default crush replicated ruleset'. 'osd
  pool default crush rule' takes precedence for backward compatibility
  and a deprecation warning is displayed when it is used.

v0.73
=====

This release, the first development release after emperor, includes
many bug fixes and a few additional pieces of functionality.  The
first batch of larger changes will be landing in the next version,
v0.74.

Upgrading
---------

- As part of fix for #6796, 'ceph osd pool set <pool> <var> <arg>' now
  receives <arg> as an integer instead of a string.  This affects how
  'hashpspool' flag is set/unset: instead of 'true' or 'false', it now
  must be '0' or '1'.

- The behavior of the CRUSH 'indep' choose mode has been changed.  No
  ceph cluster should have been using this behavior unless someone has
  manually extracted a crush map, modified a CRUSH rule to replace
  'firstn' with 'indep', recompiled, and reinjected the new map into
  the cluster.  If the 'indep' mode is currently in use on a cluster,
  the rule should be modified to use 'firstn' instead, and the
  administrator should wait until any data movement completes before
  upgrading.

- The 'osd dump' command now dumps pool snaps as an array instead of an
  object.

- The radosgw init script (sysvinit) how requires that the 'host = ...' line in
  ceph.conf, if present, match the short hostname (the output of 'hostname -s'),
  not the fully qualified hostname or the (occasionally non-short) output of
  'hostname'.  Failure to adjust this when upgrading from emperor or dumpling
  may prevent the radosgw daemon from starting.


Notable Changes
---------------

* ceph-crush-location: new hook for setting CRUSH location of osd daemons on start
* ceph-kvstore-tool: expanded command set and capabilities (Joao Eduardo Luis)
* ceph.spec: fix build dependency (Loic Dachary)
* common: fix aligned buffer allocation (Loic Dachary)
* doc: many many install doc improvements (John Wilkins)
* mds: fix readdir end check (Zheng Yan)
* mds: update old-format backtraces opportunistically (Zheng Yan)
* misc cleanups from coverity (Xing Lin)
* misc portability fixes (Noah Watkins, Christophe Courtaut, Alan Somers, huanjun)
* mon: 'osd dump' dumps pool snaps as array, not object (Dan Mick)
* mon: allow debug quorum_{enter,exit} commands via admin socket
* mon: prevent extreme changes in pool pg_num (Greg Farnum)
* mon: take 'osd pool set ...' value as an int, not string (Joao Eduardo Luis)
* mon: trim MDSMaps (Joao Eduardo Luis)
* osd: fix object_info_t encoding bug from emperor (Sam Just)
* rbd: add 'rbdmap' init script for mapping rbd images on book (Adam Twardowski)
* rgw: add 'status' command to sysvinit script (David Moreau Simard)
* rgw: fix error setting empty owner on ACLs (Yehuda Sadeh)
* rgw: optionally defer to bucket ACLs instead of object ACLs (Liam Monahan)
* rgw: support for password (instead of admin token) for keystone authentication (Christophe Courtaut)
* sysvinit, upstart: prevent both init systems from starting the same daemons (Josh Durgin)

v0.72.3 Emperor (pending release)
=================================

Upgrading
---------

* Monitor 'auth' read-only commands now expect the user to have 'rx' caps.
  This is the same behavior that was present in dumpling, but in emperor
  and more recent development releases the 'r' cap was sufficient.  Note that
  this backported security fix will break mon keys that are using the following
  commands but do not have the 'x' bit in the mon capability::

    ceph auth export
    ceph auth get
    ceph auth get-key
    ceph auth print-key
    ceph auth list


v0.72.2 Emperor
===============

This is the second bugfix release for the v0.72.x Emperor series.  We
have fixed a hang in radosgw, and fixed (again) a problem with monitor
CLI compatiblity with mixed version monitors.  (In the future this
will no longer be a problem.)

Upgrading
---------

* The JSON schema for the 'osd pool set ...' command changed slightly.  Please
  avoid issuing this particular command via the CLI while there is a mix of
  v0.72.1 and v0.72.2 monitor daemons running.

* As part of fix for #6796, 'ceph osd pool set <pool> <var> <arg>' now
  receives <arg> as an integer instead of a string.  This affects how
  'hashpspool' flag is set/unset: instead of 'true' or 'false', it now
  must be '0' or '1'.


Changes
-------

* mon: 'osd pool set ...' syntax change
* osd: added test for missing on-disk HEAD object
* osd: fix osd bench block size argument
* rgw: fix hang on large object GET
* rgw: fix rare use-after-free
* rgw: various DR bug fixes
* rgw: do not return error on empty owner when setting ACL
* sysvinit, upstart: prevent starting daemons using both init systems

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.72.2.txt>`.

v0.72.1 Emperor
===============

Important Note
--------------

When you are upgrading from Dumpling to Emperor, do not run any of the
"ceph osd pool set" commands while your monitors are running separate versions.
Doing so could result in inadvertently changing cluster configuration settings
that exhaust compute resources in your OSDs.

Changes
-------

* osd: fix upgrade bug #6761
* ceph_filestore_tool: introduced tool to repair errors caused by #6761

This release addresses issue #6761.  Upgrading to Emperor can cause
reads to begin returning ENFILE (too many open files).  v0.72.1 fixes
that upgrade issue and adds a tool ceph_filestore_tool to repair osd
stores affected by this bug.

To repair a cluster affected by this bug:

#. Upgrade all osd machines to v0.72.1
#. Install the ceph-test package on each osd machine to get ceph_filestore_tool
#. Stop all osd processes
#. To see all lost objects, run the following on each osd with the osd stopped and
   the osd data directory mounted::

     ceph_filestore_tool --list-lost-objects=true --filestore-path=<path-to-osd-filestore> --journal-path=<path-to-osd-journal>

#. To fix all lost objects, run the following on each osd with the
   osd stopped and the osd data directory mounted::

     ceph_filestore_tool --fix-lost-objects=true --list-lost-objects=true --filestore-path=<path-to-osd-filestore> --journal-path=<path-to-osd-journal>

#. Once lost objects have been repaired on each osd, you can restart
   the cluster.

Note, the ceph_filestore_tool performs a scan of all objects on the
osd and may take some time.


v0.72 Emperor
=============

This is the fifth major release of Ceph, the fourth since adopting a
3-month development cycle.  This release brings several new features,
including multi-datacenter replication for the radosgw, improved
usability, and lands a lot of incremental performance and internal
refactoring work to support upcoming features in Firefly.

Important Note
--------------

When you are upgrading from Dumpling to Emperor, do not run any of the
"ceph osd pool set" commands while your monitors are running separate versions.
Doing so could result in inadvertently changing cluster configuration settings
that exhaust compute resources in your OSDs.

Highlights
----------

* common: improved crc32c performance
* librados: new example client and class code
* mds: many bug fixes and stability improvements
* mon: health warnings when pool pg_num values are not reasonable
* mon: per-pool performance stats
* osd, librados: new object copy primitives
* osd: improved interaction with backend file system to reduce latency
* osd: much internal refactoring to support ongoing erasure coding and tiering support
* rgw: bucket quotas
* rgw: improved CORS support
* rgw: performance improvements
* rgw: validate S3 tokens against Keystone

Coincident with core Ceph, the Emperor release also brings:

* radosgw-agent: support for multi-datacenter replication for disaster recovery
* tgt: improved support for iSCSI via upstream tgt

Packages for both are available on ceph.com.

Upgrade sequencing
------------------

There are no specific upgrade restrictions on the order or sequence of
upgrading from 0.67.x Dumpling. However, you cannot run any of the
"ceph osd pool set" commands while your monitors are running separate versions.
Doing so could result in inadvertently changing cluster configuration settings
and exhausting compute resources in your OSDs.

It is also possible to do a rolling upgrade from 0.61.x Cuttlefish,
but there are ordering restrictions.  (This is the same set of
restrictions for Cuttlefish to Dumpling.)

#. Upgrade ceph-common on all nodes that will use the command line 'ceph' utility.
#. Upgrade all monitors (upgrade ceph package, restart ceph-mon
   daemons).  This can happen one daemon or host at a time.  Note that
   because cuttlefish and dumpling monitors can't talk to each other,
   all monitors should be upgraded in relatively short succession to
   minimize the risk that an a untimely failure will reduce
   availability.
#. Upgrade all osds (upgrade ceph package, restart ceph-osd daemons).
   This can happen one daemon or host at a time.
#. Upgrade radosgw (upgrade radosgw package, restart radosgw daemons).


Upgrading from v0.71
--------------------

* ceph-fuse and radosgw now use the same default values for the admin
  socket and log file paths that the other daemons (ceph-osd,
  ceph-mon, etc.) do.  If you run these daemons as non-root, you may
  need to adjust your ceph.conf to disable these options or to adjust
  the permissions on /var/run/ceph and /var/log/ceph.

Upgrading from v0.67 Dumpling
-----------------------------

* ceph-fuse and radosgw now use the same default values for the admin
  socket and log file paths that the other daemons (ceph-osd,
  ceph-mon, etc.) do.  If you run these daemons as non-root, you may
  need to adjust your ceph.conf to disable these options or to adjust
  the permissions on /var/run/ceph and /var/log/ceph.

* The MDS now disallows snapshots by default as they are not
  considered stable.  The command 'ceph mds set allow_snaps' will
  enable them.

* For clusters that were created before v0.44 (pre-argonaut, Spring
  2012) and store radosgw data, the auto-upgrade from TMAP to OMAP
  objects has been disabled.  Before upgrading, make sure that any
  buckets created on pre-argonaut releases have been modified (e.g.,
  by PUTing and then DELETEing an object from each bucket).  Any
  cluster created with argonaut (v0.48) or a later release or not
  using radosgw never relied on the automatic conversion and is not
  affected by this change.

* Any direct users of the 'tmap' portion of the librados API should be
  aware that the automatic tmap -> omap conversion functionality has
  been removed.

* Most output that used K or KB (e.g., for kilobyte) now uses a
  lower-case k to match the official SI convention.  Any scripts that
  parse output and check for an upper-case K will need to be modified.

* librados::Rados::pool_create_async() and librados::Rados::pool_delete_async()
  don't drop a reference to the completion object on error, caller needs to take
  care of that. This has never really worked correctly and we were leaking an
  object

* 'ceph osd crush set <id> <weight> <loc..>' no longer adds the osd to the
  specified location, as that's a job for 'ceph osd crush add'.  It will
  however continue to work just the same as long as the osd already exists
  in the crush map.

* The OSD now enforces that class write methods cannot both mutate an
  object and return data.  The rbd.assign_bid method, the lone
  offender, has been removed.  This breaks compatibility with
  pre-bobtail librbd clients by preventing them from creating new
  images.

* librados now returns on commit instead of ack for synchronous calls.
  This is a bit safer in the case where both OSDs and the client crash, and
  is probably how it should have been acting from the beginning. Users are
  unlikely to notice but it could result in lower performance in some
  circumstances. Those who care should switch to using the async interfaces,
  which let you specify safety semantics precisely.

* The C++ librados AioComplete::get_version() method was incorrectly
  returning an int (usually 32-bits).  To avoid breaking library
  compatibility, a get_version64() method is added that returns the
  full-width value.  The old method is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release.  Users of the C++ librados API that make use of
  the get_version() method should modify their code to avoid getting a
  value that is truncated from 64 to to 32 bits.

v0.71
=====

This development release includes a significant amount of new code and
refactoring, as well as a lot of preliminary functionality that will be needed
for erasure coding and tiering support.  There are also several significant
patch sets improving this with the MDS.

Upgrading
---------

* The MDS now disallows snapshots by default as they are not
  considered stable.  The command 'ceph mds set allow_snaps' will
  enable them.

* For clusters that were created before v0.44 (pre-argonaut, Spring

v0.70
=====

Upgrading
---------

* librados::Rados::pool_create_async() and librados::Rados::pool_delete_async()
  don't drop a reference to the completion object on error, caller needs to take
  care of that. This has never really worked correctly and we were leaking an
  object

* 'ceph osd crush set <id> <weight> <loc..>' no longer adds the osd to the
  specified location, as that's a job for 'ceph osd crush add'.  It will
  however continue to work just the same as long as the osd already exists
  in the crush map.

Notable Changes
---------------

* mon: a few 'ceph mon add' races fixed (command is now idempotent) (Joao Luis)
* crush: fix name caching
* rgw: fix a few minor memory leaks (Yehuda Sadeh)
* ceph: improve parsing of CEPH_ARGS (Benoit Knecht)
* mon: avoid rewriting full osdmaps on restart (Joao Luis)
* crc32c: fix optimized crc32c code (it now detects arch support properly)
* mon: fix 'ceph osd crush reweight ...' (Joao Luis)
* osd: revert xattr size limit (fixes large rgw uploads)
* mds: fix heap profiler commands (Joao Luis)
* rgw: fix inefficient use of std::list::size() (Yehuda Sadeh)


v0.69
=====

Upgrading
---------

* The sysvinit /etc/init.d/ceph script will, by default, update the
  CRUSH location of an OSD when it starts.  Previously, if the
  monitors were not available, this command would hang indefinitely.
  Now, that step will time out after 10 seconds and the ceph-osd daemon
  will not be started.

* Users of the librados C++ API should replace users of get_version()
  with get_version64() as the old method only returns a 32-bit value
  for a 64-bit field.  The existing 32-bit get_version() method is now
  deprecated.

* The OSDs are now more picky that request payload match their
  declared size.  A write operation across N bytes that includes M
  bytes of data will now be rejected.  No known clients do this, but
  the because the server-side behavior has changed it is possible that
  an application misusing the interface may now get errors.

* The OSD now enforces that class write methods cannot both mutate an
  object and return data.  The rbd.assign_bid method, the lone
  offender, has been removed.  This breaks compatibility with
  pre-bobtail librbd clients by preventing them from creating new
  images.

* librados now returns on commit instead of ack for synchronous calls.
  This is a bit safer in the case where both OSDs and the client crash, and
  is probably how it should have been acting from the beginning. Users are
  unlikely to notice but it could result in lower performance in some
  circumstances. Those who care should switch to using the async interfaces,
  which let you specify safety semantics precisely.

* The C++ librados AioComplete::get_version() method was incorrectly
  returning an int (usually 32-bits).  To avoid breaking library
  compatibility, a get_version64() method is added that returns the
  full-width value.  The old method is deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release.  Users of the C++ librados API that make use of
  the get_version() method should modify their code to avoid getting a
  value that is truncated from 64 to to 32 bits.

network failure detection with the monitor, and several hard to hit
OSD crashes or hangs.

We recommend that all users upgrade at their convenience.

Upgrading
---------

* The 'rbd ls' function now returns success and returns an empty when a pool
  does not store any rbd images.  Previously it would return an ENOENT error.

v0.67.7 "Dumpling"
==================

This Dumpling point release fixes a few critical issues in v0.67.6.

All v0.67.6 users are urgently encouraged to upgrade.  We also
recommend that all v0.67.5 (or older) users upgrade.

Upgrading
---------

* Once you have upgraded a radosgw instance or OSD to v0.67.7, you should not
  downgrade to a previous version.

Notable Changes
---------------

* ceph-disk: additional unit tests
* librbd: revert caching behavior change in v0.67.6
* osd: fix problem reading xattrs due to incomplete backport in v0.67.6
* radosgw-admin: fix reading object policy

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.67.7.txt>`.


v0.67.6 "Dumpling"
==================

.. note: This release contains a librbd bug that is fixed in v0.67.7.  Please upgrade to v0.67.7 and do not use v0.67.6.

This Dumpling point release contains a number of important fixed for
the OSD, monitor, and radosgw.  Most significantly, a change that
forces large object attributes to spill over into leveldb has been
backported that can prevent objects and the cluster from being damaged
by large attributes (which can be induced via the radosgw).  There is
also a set of fixes that improves data safety and RADOS semantics when
the cluster becomes full and then non-full.

We recommend that all 0.67.x Dumpling users skip this release and upgrade to v0.67.7.

Upgrading
---------

* The OSD has long contained a feature that allows large xattrs to
  spill over into the leveldb backing store in situations where not
  all local file systems are able to store them reliably.  This option
  is now enabled unconditionally in order to avoid rare cases where
  storing large xattrs renders the object unreadable. This is known to
  be triggered by very large multipart objects, but could be caused by
  other workloads as well.  Although there is some small risk that
  performance for certain workloads will degrade, it is more important
  that data be retrievable.  Note that newer versions of Ceph (e.g.,
  firefly) do some additional work to avoid the potential performance
  regression in this case, but that is current considered too complex
  for backport to the Dumpling stable series.

* It is very dangerous to downgrade from v0.67.6 to a prior version of
  Dumpling.  If the old version does not have 'filestore xattr use
  omap = true' it may not be able to read all xattrs for an object and
  can cause undefined behavior.

Notable changes
---------------

* ceph-disk: misc bug fixes, particularly on RHEL (Loic Dachary, Alfredo Deza, various)
* ceph-fuse, libcephfs: fix crash from read over certain sparseness patterns (Sage Weil)

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.67.6.txt>`.


v0.67.5 "Dumpling"
==================

This release includes a few critical bug fixes for the radosgw, 
including a fix for hanging operations on large objects.  There are also
several bug fixes for radosgw multi-site replications, and a few 
backported features.  Also, notably, the 'osd perf' command (which dumps
recent performance information about active OSDs) has been backported.

We recommend that all 0.67.x Dumpling users upgrade.

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.67.3.txt>`.


v0.67.2 "Dumpling"
==================

This is an imporant point release for Dumpling.  Most notably, it
fixes a problem when upgrading directly from v0.56.x Bobtail to
v0.67.x Dumpling (without stopping at v0.61.x Cuttlefish along the
way).  It also fixes a problem with the CLI parsing of the CEPH_ARGS
environment variable, high CPU utilization by the ceph-osd daemons,
and cleans up the radosgw shutdown sequence.

Notable Changes
---------------

* objecter: resend linger requests when cluster goes from full to non-full
* ceph: parse CEPH_ARGS environment variable
* librados: fix small memory leak
* osd: remove old log objects on upgrade (fixes bobtail -> dumpling jump)
* osd: disable PGLog::check() via config option (fixes CPU burn)
* rgw: drain requests on shutdown
* rgw: misc memory leaks on shutdown

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.67.2.txt>`.


v0.67.1 "Dumpling"
==================

This is a minor point release for Dumpling that fixes problems with
OpenStack and librbd hangs when caching is disabled.

Notable changes
---------------

* librados, librbd: fix constructor for python bindings with certain
  usages (in particular, that used by OpenStack)
* librados, librbd: fix aio_flush wakeup when cache is disabled
* librados: fix locking for aio completion refcounting
* fixes 'ceph --admin-daemon ...' command error code on error
* fixes 'ceph daemon ... config set ...' command for boolean config
  options.

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.67.1.txt>`.

v0.67 "Dumpling"
================

This is the fourth major release of Ceph, code-named "Dumpling."  The
headline features for this release include:

* Multi-site support for radosgw.  This includes the ability to set up
  separate "regions" in the same or different Ceph clusters that share
  a single S3/Swift bucket/container namespace.

* RESTful API endpoint for Ceph cluster administration.
  ceph-rest-api, a wrapper around ceph_rest_api.py, can be used to
  start up a test single-threaded HTTP server that provides access to
  cluster information and administration in very similar ways to the
  ceph commandline tool.  ceph_rest_api.py can be used as a WSGI
  application for deployment in a more-capable web server.  See
  ceph-rest-api.8 for more.

* Object namespaces in librados.


.. _Dumpling upgrade:

Upgrade Sequencing
------------------

It is possible to do a rolling upgrade from Cuttlefish to Dumpling.

#. Upgrade ceph-common on all nodes that will use the command line
   'ceph' utility.
#. Upgrade all monitors (upgrade ceph package, restart ceph-mon
   daemons).  This can happen one daemon or host at a time.  Note that
   because cuttlefish and dumpling monitors can't talk to each other,
   all monitors should be upgraded in relatively short succession to
   minimize the risk that an a untimely failure will reduce
   availability.
#. Upgrade all osds (upgrade ceph package, restart ceph-osd daemons).
   This can happen one daemon or host at a time.
#. Upgrade radosgw (upgrade radosgw package, restart radosgw daemons).


Upgrading from v0.66
--------------------

* There is monitor internal protocol change, which means that v0.67
  ceph-mon daemons cannot talk to v0.66 or older daemons.  We
  recommend upgrading all monitors at once (or in relatively quick
  succession) to minimize the possibility of downtime.

* The output of 'ceph status --format=json' or 'ceph -s --format=json'
  has changed to return status information in a more structured and
  usable format.

* The 'ceph pg dump_stuck [threshold]' command used to require a
  --threshold or -t prefix to the threshold argument, but now does
  not.

* Many more ceph commands now output formatted information; select
  with '--format=<format>', where <format> can be 'json', 'json-pretty',
  'xml', or 'xml-pretty'.

* The 'ceph pg <pgid> ...' commands (like 'ceph pg <pgid> query') are
  deprecated in favor of 'ceph tell <pgid> ...'.  This makes the
  distinction between 'ceph pg <command> <pgid>' and 'ceph pg <pgid>
  <command>' less awkward by making it clearer that the 'tell'
  commands are talking to the OSD serving the placement group, not the
  monitor.

* The 'ceph --admin-daemon <path> <command ...>' used to accept the
  command and arguments as either a single string or as separate
  arguments.  It will now only accept the command spread across
  multiple arguments.  This means that any script which does something
  like::

    ceph --admin-daemon /var/run/ceph/ceph-osd.0.asok 'config set debug_ms 1'

  needs to remove the quotes.  Also, note that the above can now be
  shortened to::

    ceph daemon osd.0 config set debug_ms 1

* The radosgw caps were inconsistently documented to be either 'mon =
  allow r' or 'mon = allow rw'.  The 'mon = allow rw' is required for
  radosgw to create its own pools.  All documentation has been updated
  accordingly.

* The radosgw copy object operation may return extra progress info
  during the operation. At this point it will only happen when doing
  cross zone copy operations. The S3 response will now return extra
  <Progress> field under the <CopyResult> container. The Swift
  response will now send the progress as a json array.

* In v0.66 and v0.65 the HASHPSPOOL pool flag was enabled by default
  for new pools, but has been disabled again until Linux kernel client
  support reaches more distributions and users.

* ceph-osd now requires a max file descriptor limit (e.g., ``ulimit -n
  ...``) of at least
  filestore_wbthrottle_(xfs|btrfs)_inodes_hard_limit (5000 by default)
  in order to accomodate the new write back throttle system.  On
  Ubuntu, upstart now sets the fd limit to 32k.  On other platforms,
  the sysvinit script will set it to 32k by default (still
  overrideable via max_open_files).  If this field has been customized
  in ceph.conf it should likely be adjusted upwards.

Upgrading from v0.61 "Cuttlefish"
---------------------------------

In addition to the above notes about upgrading from v0.66:

* There has been a huge revamp of the 'ceph' command-line interface
  implementation.  The ``ceph-common`` client library needs to be
  upgrade before ``ceph-mon`` is restarted in order to avoid problems
  using the CLI (the old ``ceph`` client utility cannot talk to the
  new ``ceph-mon``).

* The CLI is now very careful about sending the 'status' one-liner
  output to stderr and command output to stdout.  Scripts relying on
  output should take care.

* The 'ceph osd tell ...' and 'ceph mon tell ...' commands are no
  longer supported.  Any callers should use::

	ceph tell osd.<id or *> ...
	ceph tell mon.<id or name or *> ...

  The 'ceph mds tell ...' command is still there, but will soon also
  transition to 'ceph tell mds.<id or name or \*> ...'

* The 'ceph osd crush add ...' command used to take one of two forms::

    ceph osd crush add 123 osd.123 <weight> <location ...>
    ceph osd crush add osd.123 <weight> <location ...>

  This is because the id and crush name are redundant.  Now only the
  simple form is supported, where the osd name/id can either be a bare
  id (integer) or name (osd.<id>)::

    ceph osd crush add osd.123 <weight> <location ...>
    ceph osd crush add 123 <weight> <location ...>

* There is now a maximum RADOS object size, configurable via 'osd max
  object size', defaulting to 100 GB.  Note that this has no effect on
  RBD, CephFS, or radosgw, which all stripe over objects. If you are
  using librados and storing objects larger than that, you will need
  to adjust 'osd max object size', and should consider using smaller
  objects instead.

* The 'osd min down {reporters|reports}' config options have been
  renamed to 'mon osd min down {reporters|reports}', and the
  documentation has been updated to reflect that these options apply
  to the monitors (who process failure reports) and not OSDs.  If you
  have adjusted these settings, please update your ``ceph.conf``
  accordingly.

v0.64
=====

Upgrading
---------

* New pools now have the HASHPSPOOL flag set by default to provide
  better distribution over OSDs.  Support for this feature was
  introduced in v0.59 and Linux kernel version v3.9.  If you wish to
  access the cluster from an older kernel, set the 'osd pool default
  flag hashpspool = false' option in your ceph.conf prior to creating
  the cluster or creating new pools.  Note that the presense of any
  pool in the cluster with the flag enabled will make the OSD require
  support from all clients.

====================

This release includes a number of important issues, including rare
race conditions in the OSD, a few monitor bugs, and fixes for RBD
flush behavior.  We recommend that production users upgrade at their
convenience.

Notable Changes
---------------

* librados: fix async aio completion wakeup
* librados: fix aio completion locking

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.61.8.txt>`.


v0.61.7 "Cuttlefish"
====================

This release fixes another regression preventing monitors to start after
undergoing certain upgrade sequences, as well as some corner cases with
Paxos and support for unusual device names in ceph-disk/ceph-deploy.

Notable Changes
---------------

* mon: fix regression in latest full osdmap retrieval
* mon: fix a long-standing bug in a paxos corner case
* ceph-disk: improved support for unusual device names (e.g., /dev/cciss/c0d0)

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.61.7.txt>`.


v0.61.6 "Cuttlefish"
====================

This release fixes a regression in v0.61.5 that could prevent monitors
from restarting.  This affects any cluster that was upgraded from a
previous version of Ceph (and not freshly created with v0.61.5).

All users are strongly recommended to upgrade.

Notable Changes
---------------

* mon: record latest full osdmap
* mon: work around previous bug in which latest full osdmap is not recorded
* mon: avoid scrub while updating

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.61.6.txt>`.


v0.61.5 "Cuttlefish"
====================

This release most improves stability of the monitor and fixes a few
bugs with the ceph-disk utility (used by ceph-deploy).  We recommand
that all v0.61.x users upgrade.

Upgrading
---------

* This release fixes a 32-bit vs 64-bit arithmetic bug with the
  feature bits.  An unfortunate consequence of the fix is that 0.61.4
  (or earlier) ceph-mon daemons can't form a quorum with 0.61.5 (or
  later) monitors.  To avoid the possibility of service disruption, we
  recommend you upgrade all monitors at once.

Notable Changes
---------------

* mon: misc sync improvements (faster, more reliable, better tuning)
* mon: enable leveldb cache by default (big performance improvement)
* mon: new scrub feature (primarily for diagnostic, testing purposes)
* mon: fix occasional leveldb assertion on startup
* mon: prevent reads until initial state is committed
* mon: improved logic for trimming old osdmaps
* mon: fix pick_addresses bug when expanding mon cluster
* mon: several small paxos fixes, improvements
* mon: fix bug osdmap trim behavior
* osd: fix several bugs with PG stat reporting

* rgw: fix radosgw-admin buckets list (for all buckets)
* mds: fix occasional client failure to reconnect
* mds: fix bad list traversal after unlink
* mds: fix underwater dentry cleanup (occasional crash after mds restart)
* libcephfs, ceph-fuse: fix occasional hangs on umount
* libcephfs, ceph-fuse: fix old bug with O_LAZY vs O_NOATIME confusion
* ceph-disk: more robust journal device detection on RHEL/CentOS
* ceph-disk: better, simpler locking
* ceph-disk: do not inadvertantely mount over existing osd mounts
* ceph-disk: better handling for unusual device names
* sysvinit, upstart: handle symlinks in /var/lib/ceph/*

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.61.5.txt>`.


v0.61.4 "Cuttlefish"
====================

This release resolves a possible data corruption on power-cycle when
using XFS, a few outstanding problems with monitor sync, several
problems with ceph-disk and ceph-deploy operation, and a problem with
OSD memory usage during scrub.

Upgrading
---------

* No issues.

Notable Changes
---------------

* mon: fix daemon exit behavior when error is encountered on startup
* mon: more robust sync behavior
* osd: do not use sync_file_range(2), posix_fadvise(...DONTNEED) (can cause data corruption on power loss on XFS)
* osd: avoid unnecessary log rewrite (improves peering speed)
* osd: fix scrub efficiency bug (problematic on old clusters)
* rgw: fix listing objects that start with underscore

* ceph-fuse, libcephfs: handle mds session reset during session open
* ceph-fuse, libcephfs: fix two capability revocation bugs
* ceph-fuse: fix thread creation on startup
* all daemons: create /var/run/ceph directory on startup if missing

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.61.4.txt>`.


v0.61.3 "Cuttlefish"
====================

This release resolves a number of problems with the monitors and leveldb that users have
been seeing.  Please upgrade.

Upgrading
---------

* There is one known problem with mon upgrades from bobtail.  If the
  ceph-mon conversion on startup is aborted or fails for some reason, we
  do not correctly error out, but instead continue with (in certain cases)
  odd results.  Please be careful if you have to restart the mons during
  the upgrade.  A 0.61.4 release with a fix will be out shortly.

* In the meantime, for current cuttlefish users, v0.61.3 is safe to use.


Notable Changes
---------------

* mon: paxos state trimming fix (resolves runaway disk usage)
* mon: finer-grained compaction on trim
* mon: discard messages from disconnected clients (lowers load)
* mon: leveldb compaction and other stats available via admin socket
* mon: async compaction (lower overhead)

* rgw: fix iteration over large/untrimmed usage logs
* rgw: fix locking issue with ops log socket
* rgw: require matching version of librados
* librbd: make image creation defaults configurable (e.g., create format 2 images via qemu-img)
* fix units in 'ceph df' output
* debian: fix prerm/postinst hooks to start/stop daemons appropriately
* upstart: allow uppercase daemons names (and thus hostnames)
* sysvinit: fix enumeration of local daemons by type
* sysvinit: fix osd weight calcuation when using -a

v0.61 "Cuttlefish"
==================

Upgrading from v0.60
--------------------

* The ceph-deploy tool is now the preferred method of provisioning
  new clusters.  For existing clusters created via mkcephfs that
  would like to transition to the new tool, there is a migration
  path, documented at `Transitioning to ceph-deploy`_.


* The sysvinit script (/etc/init.d/ceph) will now verify (and, if
  necessary, update) the OSD's position in the CRUSH map on startup.
  (The upstart script has always worked this way.) By default, this
  ensures that the OSD is under a 'host' with a name that matches the
  hostname (``hostname -s``).  Legacy clusters create with mkcephfs do
  this by default, so this should not cause any problems, but legacy
  clusters with customized CRUSH maps with an alternate structure
  should set ``osd crush update on start = false``.

* radosgw-admin now uses the term zone instead of cluster to describe
  each instance of the radosgw data store (and corresponding
  collection of radosgw daemons).  The usage for the radosgw-admin
  command and the 'rgw zone root pool' config options have changed
  accordingly.

* rbd progress indicators now go to standard error instead of standard
  out.  (You can disable progress with --no-progress.)

* The 'rbd resize ...' command now requires the --allow-shrink option
  when resizing to a smaller size.  Expanding images to a larger size
  is unchanged.

* Please review the changes going back to 0.56.4 if you are upgrading
  all the way from bobtail.

* The old 'ceph stop_cluster' command has been removed.

* The sysvinit script now uses the ceph.conf file on the remote host
  when starting remote daemons via the '-a' option.  Note that if '-a'
  is used in conjunction with '-c path', the path must also be present
  on the remote host (it is not copied to a temporary file, as it was
  previously).


Upgrading from v0.56.4 "Bobtail"
--------------------------------

Please see `Upgrading from Bobtail to Cuttlefish`_ for details.

* The ceph-deploy tool is now the preferred method of provisioning
  new clusters.  For existing clusters created via mkcephfs that
  would like to transition to the new tool, there is a migration
  path, documented at `Transitioning to ceph-deploy`_.

  accordingly.

* rbd progress indicators now go to standard error instead of standard
  out.  (You can disable progress with --no-progress.)

* The 'rbd resize ...' command now requires the --allow-shrink option
  when resizing to a smaller size.  Expanding images to a larger size
  is unchanged.

* Please review the changes going back to 0.56.4 if you are upgrading
  all the way from bobtail.

* The old 'ceph stop_cluster' command has been removed.

* The sysvinit script now uses the ceph.conf file on the remote host
  when starting remote daemons via the '-a' option.  Note that if '-a'
  is used in conjuction with '-c path', the path must also be present
  on the remote host (it is not copied to a temporary file, as it was
  previously).

* The monitor is using a completely new storage strategy and
  intra-cluster protocol.  This means that cuttlefish and bobtail
  monitors do not talk to each other.  When you upgrade each one, it
  will convert its local data store to the new format.  Once you
  upgrade a majority, the quorum will be formed using the new protocol
  and the old monitors will be blocked out until they too get
  upgraded.  For this reason, we recommend not running a mixed-version
  cluster for very long.

* ceph-mon now requires the creation of its data directory prior to
  --mkfs, similarly to what happens on ceph-osd.  This directory is no
  longer automatically created, and custom scripts should be adjusted to
  reflect just that.

* The monitor now enforces that MDS names be unique.  If you have
  multiple daemons start with with the same id (e.g., ``mds.a``) the
  second one will implicitly mark the first as failed.  This makes
  things less confusing and makes a daemon restart faster (we no
  longer wait for the stopped daemon to time out) but existing
  multi-mds configurations may need to be adjusted accordingly to give
  daemons unique names.

* The 'ceph osd pool delete <poolname>' and 'rados rmpool <poolname>'
  now have safety interlocks with loud warnings that make you confirm
  pool removal.  Any scripts curenty rely on these functions zapping
  data without confirmation need to be adjusted accordingly.

accumulated over the last couple months.  Most of the bug fixes (with
the notable exception of the MDS related work) has already been
backported to v0.56.x, and is not mentioned here.

Upgrading

=================

Upgrading
---------

* There is a fix in the syntax for the output of 'ceph osd tree --format=json'.

* The MDS disk format has changed from prior releases *and* from v0.57.  In particular,
  upgrades to v0.56.4 are safe, but you cannot move from v0.56.4 to v0.57 if you are using
  the MDS for CephFS; you must upgrade directly to v0.58 (or later) instead.

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.56.4.txt>`.

v0.56.3 "bobtail"
=================

This release has several bug fixes surrounding OSD stability.  Most
significantly, an issue with OSDs being unresponsive shortly after
startup (and occasionally crashing due to an internal heartbeat check)
is resolved.  Please upgrade.

Upgrading
---------

* A bug was fixed in which the OSDMap epoch for PGs without any IO
  requests was not recorded.  If there are pools in the cluster that
  are completely idle (for example, the ``data`` and ``metadata``
  pools normally used by CephFS), and a large number of OSDMap epochs
  have elapsed since the ``ceph-osd`` daemon was last restarted, those
  maps will get reprocessed when the daemon restarts.  This process
  can take a while if there are a lot of maps.  A workaround is to
  'touch' any idle pools with IO prior to restarting the daemons after
  packages are upgraded::

   rados bench 10 write -t 1 -b 4096 -p {POOLNAME}

  This will typically generate enough IO to touch every PG in the pool
  without generating significant cluster load, and also cleans up any
  temporary objects it creates.

Notable changes
---------------

* osd: flush peering work queue prior to start
* osd: persist osdmap epoch for idle PGs
* osd: fix and simplify connection handling for heartbeats
* osd: avoid crash on invalid admin command
* mon: fix rare races with monitor elections and commands
* mon: enforce that OSD reweights be between 0 and 1 (NOTE: not CRUSH weights)
* mon: approximate client, recovery bandwidth logging
* radosgw: fixed some XML formatting to conform to Swift API inconsistency
* radosgw: fix usage accounting bug; add repair tool
* radosgw: make fallback URI configurable (necessary on some web servers)
* librbd: fix handling for interrupted 'unprotect' operations
* mds, ceph-fuse: allow file and directory layouts to be modified via virtual xattrs

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.56.3.txt>`.


v0.56.2 "bobtail"
=================

This release has a wide range of bug fixes, stability improvements, and some performance improvements.  Please upgrade.

Upgrading
---------

* The meaning of the 'osd scrub min interval' and 'osd scrub max
  interval' has changed slightly.  The min interval used to be
  meaningless, while the max interval would only trigger a scrub if
  the load was sufficiently low.  Now, the min interval option works
  the way the old max interval did (it will trigger a scrub after this
  amount of time if the load is low), while the max interval will
  force a scrub regardless of load.  The default options have been
  adjusted accordingly.  If you have customized these in ceph.conf,
  please review their values when upgrading.

* CRUSH maps that are generated by default when calling ``ceph-mon
  --mkfs`` directly now distribute replicas across hosts instead of
  across OSDs.  Any provisioning tools that are being used by Ceph may
  be affected, although probably for the better, as distributing across
  hosts is a much more commonly sought behavior.  If you use
  ``mkcephfs`` to create the cluster, the default CRUSH rule is still
  inferred by the number of hosts and/or racks in the initial ceph.conf.

v0.56.1 "bobtail"
=================

This release has two critical fixes.  Please upgrade.

Upgrading
---------

* There is a protocol compatibility problem between v0.56 and any
  other version that is now fixed.  If your radosgw or RBD clients are
  running v0.56, they will need to be upgraded too.  If they are
  running a version prior to v0.56, they can be left as is.

Notable changes
---------------
* osd: fix commit sequence for XFS, ext4 (or any other non-btrfs) to prevent data loss on power cycle or kernel panic
* osd: fix compatibility for CALL operation
* osd: process old osdmaps prior to joining cluster (fixes slow startup)
* osd: fix a couple of recovery-related crashes
* osd: fix large io requests when journal is in (non-default) aio mode
* log: fix possible deadlock in logging code

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.56.1.txt>`.

v0.56 "bobtail"
===============

Bobtail is the second stable release of Ceph, named in honor of the
`Bobtail Squid`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobtail_squid.

Key features since v0.48 "argonaut"
-----------------------------------

* Object Storage Daemon (OSD): improved threading, small-io performance, and performance during recovery
* Object Storage Daemon (OSD): regular "deep" scrubbing of all stored data to detect latent disk errors
* RADOS Block Device (RBD): support for copy-on-write clones of images.
* RADOS Block Device (RBD): better client-side caching.
* RADOS Block Device (RBD): advisory image locking
* Rados Gateway (RGW): support for efficient usage logging/scraping (for billing purposes)
* Rados Gateway (RGW): expanded S3 and Swift API coverage (e.g., POST, multi-object delete)
* Rados Gateway (RGW): improved striping for large objects
* Rados Gateway (RGW): OpenStack Keystone integration
* RPM packages for Fedora, RHEL/CentOS, OpenSUSE, and SLES
* mkcephfs: support for automatically formatting and mounting XFS and ext4 (in addition to btrfs)

Upgrading
---------

Please refer to the document `Upgrading from Argonaut to Bobtail`_ for details.

.. _Upgrading from Argonaut to Bobtail: ../install/upgrading-ceph/#upgrading-from-argonaut-to-bobtail

* Cephx authentication is now enabled by default (since v0.55).
  Upgrading a cluster without adjusting the Ceph configuration will
  likely prevent the system from starting up on its own.  We recommend
  first modifying the configuration to indicate that authentication is
  disabled, and only then upgrading to the latest version.::

     auth client required = none
     auth service required = none
     auth cluster required = none

* Ceph daemons can be upgraded one-by-one while the cluster is online
  and in service.

* The ``ceph-osd`` daemons must be upgraded and restarted *before* any
  ``radosgw`` daemons are restarted, as they depend on some new
  ceph-osd functionality.  (The ``ceph-mon``, ``ceph-osd``, and
  ``ceph-mds`` daemons can be upgraded and restarted in any order.)

* Once each individual daemon has been upgraded and restarted, it
  cannot be downgraded.

* The cluster of ``ceph-mon`` daemons will migrate to a new internal
  on-wire protocol once all daemons in the quorum have been upgraded.
  Upgrading only a majority of the nodes (e.g., two out of three) may
  expose the cluster to a situation where a single additional failure
  may compromise availability (because the non-upgraded daemon cannot
  participate in the new protocol).  We recommend not waiting for an
  extended period of time between ``ceph-mon`` upgrades.

* The ops log and usage log for radosgw are now off by default.  If
  you need these logs (e.g., for billing purposes), you must enable
  them explicitly.  For logging of all operations to objects in the
  ``.log`` pool (see ``radosgw-admin log ...``)::

    rgw enable ops log = true

  For usage logging of aggregated bandwidth usage (see ``radosgw-admin
  usage ...``)::

    rgw enable usage log = true

* You should not create or use "format 2" RBD images until after all
  ``ceph-osd`` daemons have been upgraded.  Note that "format 1" is
  still the default.  You can use the new ``ceph osd ls`` and
  ``ceph tell osd.N version`` commands to doublecheck your cluster.
  ``ceph osd ls`` will give a list of all OSD IDs that are part of the
  cluster, and you can use that to write a simple shell loop to display
  all the OSD version strings: ::

      for i in $(ceph osd ls); do
          ceph tell osd.${i} version
      done


Compatibility changes
---------------------

* The 'ceph osd create [<uuid>]' command now rejects an argument that
  is not a UUID.  (Previously it would take take an optional integer
  OSD id.)  This correct syntax has been 'ceph osd create [<uuid>]'
  since v0.47, but the older calling convention was being silently
  ignored.

* The CRUSH map root nodes now have type ``root`` instead of type
  ``pool``.  This avoids confusion with RADOS pools, which are not
  directly related.  Any scripts or tools that use the ``ceph osd
  crush ...`` commands may need to be adjusted accordingly.

* The ``ceph osd pool create <poolname> <pgnum>`` command now requires
  the ``pgnum`` argument. Previously this was optional, and would
  default to 8, which was almost never a good number.

* Degraded mode (when there fewer than the desired number of replicas)
  is now more configurable on a per-pool basis, with the min_size
  parameter. By default, with min_size 0, this allows I/O to objects
  with N - floor(N/2) replicas, where N is the total number of
  expected copies. Argonaut behavior was equivalent to having min_size
  = 1, so I/O would always be possible if any completely up to date
  copy remained. min_size = 1 could result in lower overall
  availability in certain cases, such as flapping network partitions.

* The sysvinit start/stop script now defaults to adjusting the max
  open files ulimit to 16384.  On most systems the default is 1024, so
  this is an increase and won't break anything.  If some system has a
  higher initial value, however, this change will lower the limit.
  The value can be adjusted explicitly by adding an entry to the
  ``ceph.conf`` file in the appropriate section.  For example::

     [global]
             max open files = 32768

* 'rbd lock list' and 'rbd showmapped' no longer use tabs as
  separators in their output.

* There is configurable limit on the number of PGs when creating a new
  pool, to prevent a user from accidentally specifying a ridiculous
  number for pg_num.  It can be adjusted via the 'mon max pool pg num'
  option on the monitor, and defaults to 65536 (the current max
  supported by the Linux kernel client).

* The osd capabilities associated with a rados user have changed
  syntax since 0.48 argonaut. The new format is mostly backwards
  compatible, but there are two backwards-incompatible changes:

  * specifying a list of pools in one grant, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo,bar' is now done in separate grants, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo, allow r pool=bar'.

  * restricting pool access by pool owner ('allow r uid=foo') is
    removed. This feature was not very useful and unused in practice.

  The new format is documented in the ceph-authtool man page.

* 'rbd cp' and 'rbd rename' use rbd as the default destination pool,
  regardless of what pool the source image is in. Previously they
  would default to the same pool as the source image.

* 'rbd export' no longer prints a message for each object written. It
  just reports percent complete like other long-lasting operations.

* 'ceph osd tree' now uses 4 decimal places for weight so output is
  nicer for humans

* Several monitor operations are now idempotent:

  * ceph osd pool create
  * ceph osd pool delete
  * ceph osd pool mksnap
  * ceph osd rm
  * ceph pg <pgid> revert

v0.54
=====

Upgrading
---------

* The osd capabilities associated with a rados user have changed
  syntax since 0.48 argonaut. The new format is mostly backwards
  compatible, but there are two backwards-incompatible changes:

  * specifying a list of pools in one grant, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo,bar' is now done in separate grants, i.e.
    'allow r pool=foo, allow r pool=bar'.

  * restricting pool access by pool owner ('allow r uid=foo') is
    removed. This feature was not very useful and unused in practice.

  The new format is documented in the ceph-authtool man page.

* Bug fixes to the new osd capability format parsing properly validate
  the allowed operations. If an existing rados user gets permissions
  errors after upgrading, its capabilities were probably
  misconfigured. See the ceph-authtool man page for details on osd
  capabilities.

* 'rbd lock list' and 'rbd showmapped' no longer use tabs as
  separators in their output.

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.48.2argonaut.txt>`.

v0.48.1 "argonaut"
==================

Upgrading
---------

* The radosgw usage trim function was effectively broken in v0.48.  Earlier it would remove more usage data than what was requested.  This is fixed in v0.48.1, but the fix is incompatible.  The v0.48 radosgw-admin tool cannot be used to initiate the trimming; please use the v0.48.1 version.

* v0.48.1 now explicitly indicates support for the CRUSH_TUNABLES feature.  No other version of Ceph requires this, yet, but future versions will when the tunables are adjusted from their historical defaults.

* There are no other compatibility changes between v0.48.1 and v0.48.

Notable changes
---------------

* mkcephfs: use default 'keyring', 'osd data', 'osd journal' paths when not specified in conf
* msgr: various fixes to socket error handling
* osd: reduce scrub overhead
* osd: misc peering fixes (past_interval sharing, pgs stuck in 'peering' states)
* osd: fail on EIO in read path (do not silently ignore read errors from failing disks)
* osd: avoid internal heartbeat errors by breaking some large transactions into pieces
* osd: fix osdmap catch-up during startup (catch up and then add daemon to osdmap)
* osd: fix spurious 'misdirected op' messages
* osd: report scrub status via 'pg ... query'
* rbd: fix race when watch registrations are resent
* rbd: fix rbd image id assignment scheme (new image data objects have slightly different names)
* rbd: fix perf stats for cache hit rate
* rbd tool: fix off-by-one in key name (crash when empty key specified)
* rbd: more robust udev rules
* rados tool: copy object, pool commands

* radosgw: misc API compatibility fixes (date strings, ETag quoting, swift headers, etc.)
* ceph-fuse: fix locking in read/write paths
* mon: fix rare race corrupting on-disk data
* config: fix admin socket 'config set' command
* log: fix in-memory log event gathering
* debian: remove crush headers, include librados-config
* rpm: add ceph-disk-{activate, prepare}

For more detailed information, see :download:`the complete changelog <changelog/v0.48.1argonaut.txt>`.

v0.48 "argonaut"
================

Upgrading
---------

* This release includes a disk format upgrade.  Each ceph-osd daemon, upon startup, will migrate its locally stored data to the new format.  This process can take a while (for large object counts, even hours), especially on non-btrfs file systems.  

* To keep the cluster available while the upgrade is in progress, we recommend you upgrade a storage node or rack at a time, and wait for the cluster to recover each time.  To prevent the cluster from moving data around in response to the OSD daemons being down for minutes or hours, you may want to::

    ceph osd set noout

  This will prevent the cluster from marking down OSDs as "out" and re-replicating the data elsewhere. If you do this, be sure to clear the flag when the upgrade is complete::

    ceph osd unset noout

* There is a encoding format change internal to the monitor cluster. The monitor daemons are careful to switch to the new format only when all members of the quorum support it.  However, that means that a partial quorum with new code may move to the new format, and a recovering monitor running old code will be unable to join (it will crash).  If this occurs, simply upgrading the remaining monitor will resolve the problem.

* The ceph tool's -s and -w commands from previous versions are incompatible with this version. Upgrade your client tools at the same time you upgrade the monitors if you rely on those commands.

* It is not possible to downgrade from v0.48 to a previous version.

Notable changes
---------------

* osd: stability improvements
* osd: capability model simplification
* osd: simpler/safer --mkfs (no longer removes all files; safe to re-run on active osd)
* osd: potentially buggy FIEMAP behavior disabled by default
* rbd: caching improvements
* rbd: improved instrumentation
* rbd: bug fixes
* radosgw: new, scalable usage logging infrastructure
* radosgw: per-user bucket limits
* mon: streamlined process for setting up authentication keys
* mon: stability improvements
* mon: log message throttling
* doc: improved documentation (ceph, rbd, radosgw, chef, etc.)
* config: new default locations for daemon keyrings
* config: arbitrary variable substitutions
* improved 'admin socket' daemon admin interface (ceph --admin-daemon ...)
* chef: support for multiple monitor clusters
* upstart: basic support for monitors, mds, radosgw; osd support still a work in progress.

The new default keyring locations mean that when enabling authentication (``auth supported = cephx``), keyring locations do not need to be specified if the keyring file is located inside the daemon's data directory (``/var/lib/ceph/$type/ceph-$id`` by default).

There is also a lot of librbd code in this release that is laying the groundwork for the upcoming layering functionality, but is not actually used. Likewise, the upstart support is still incomplete and not recommended; we will backport that functionality later if it turns out to be non-disruptive.
