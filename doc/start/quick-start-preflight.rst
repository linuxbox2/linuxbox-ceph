 Preflight Checklist
=====================

.. versionadded:: 0.60

Thank you for trying Ceph! We recommend setting up a ``ceph-deploy`` admin
:term:`node` and a 3-node :term:`Ceph Storage Cluster` to explore the basics of
Ceph. This **Preflight Checklist** will help you prepare a ``ceph-deploy`` 
admin node and three Ceph Nodes (or virtual machines) that will host your Ceph 
Storage Cluster. Before proceeding any further, see `OS Recommendations`_ to 
verify that you have a supported distribution and version of Linux. When 
you use a single Linux distribution and version across the cluster, it will 
make it easier for you to troubleshoot issues that arise in production. 

In the descriptions below, :term:`Node` refers to a single machine.

Ceph Deploy Setup
=================

Add Ceph repositories to the ``ceph-deploy`` admin node. Then, install
``ceph-deploy``.

Advanced Package Tool (APT)
---------------------------

For Debian and Ubuntu distributions, perform the following steps:

#. Add the release key::

	wget -q -O- 'https://ceph.com/git/?p=ceph.git;a=blob_plain;f=keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -

#. Add the Ceph packages to your repository. Replace ``{ceph-stable-release}``
   with a stable Ceph release (e.g., ``cuttlefish``, ``dumpling``,
   ``emperor``, ``firefly``, etc.).
   For example::

	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-{ceph-stable-release}/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list

#. Update your repository and install ``ceph-deploy``::

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ceph-deploy

.. note:: You can also use the EU mirror eu.ceph.com for downloading your packages.
   Simply replace ``http://ceph.com/`` by ``http://eu.ceph.com/``


Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)
-----------------------------

For Red Hat(rhel6, rhel7), CentOS (el6, el7), and Fedora 19-20 (f19-f20) perform the
following steps:

#. Add the package to your repository. Open a text editor and create a
   Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM) entry. Use the file path
   ``/etc/yum.repos.d/ceph.repo``. For example::

	sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/ceph.repo

   Paste the following example code. Replace ``{ceph-release}`` with
   the recent major release of Ceph (e.g., ``firefly``). Replace ``{distro}``
   with your Linux distribution (e.g., ``el6`` for CentOS 6, ``rhel6.5`` for
   Red Hat 6.5, ``rhel7`` for Red Hat 7, and ``fc19`` or ``fc20`` for Fedora 19
   or Fedora 20. Finally, save the contents to the 
   ``/etc/yum.repos.d/ceph.repo`` file. ::

	[ceph-noarch]
	name=Ceph noarch packages
	baseurl=http://ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/{distro}/noarch
	enabled=1
	gpgcheck=1
	type=rpm-md
	gpgkey=https://ceph.com/git/?p=ceph.git;a=blob_plain;f=keys/release.asc


#. Update your repository and install ``ceph-deploy``::

	sudo yum update && sudo yum install ceph-deploy


.. note:: You can also use the EU mirror eu.ceph.com for downloading your packages.
   Simply replace ``http://ceph.com/`` by ``http://eu.ceph.com/``


Ceph Node Setup
===============

The admin node must be have password-less SSH access to Ceph nodes. 
When ceph-deploy logs in to a Ceph node as a user, that particular
user must have passwordless ``sudo`` privileges.


Install NTP
-----------

We recommend installing NTP on Ceph nodes (especially on Ceph Monitor nodes) to
prevent issues arising from clock drift. See `Clock`_ for details.

On CentOS / RHEL, execute:: 

	sudo yum install ntp ntpdate ntp-doc

On Debian / Ubuntu, execute::

	sudo apt-get install ntp

Ensure that you enable the NTP service. Ensure that each Ceph Node uses the 
same NTP time server. See `NTP`_ for details.


Install SSH Server
------------------

For **ALL** Ceph Nodes perform the following steps:

#. Install an SSH server (if necessary) on each Ceph Node::

	sudo apt-get install openssh-server

   or::

	sudo yum install openssh-server


#. Ensure the SSH server is running on **ALL** Ceph Nodes.


Create a Ceph User
------------------

The ``ceph-deploy`` utility must login to a Ceph node as a user
that has passwordless ``sudo`` privileges, because it needs to install
software and configuration files without prompting for passwords. 

Recent versions of ``ceph-deploy`` support a ``--username`` option so you can
specify any user that has password-less ``sudo`` (including ``root``, although
this is **NOT** recommended). To use ``ceph-deploy --username {username}``, the
user you specify must have password-less SSH access to the Ceph node, as
``ceph-deploy`` will not prompt you for a password.

We recommend creating a Ceph user on **ALL** Ceph nodes in the cluster. A
uniform user name across the cluster may improve ease of use  (not required),
but you should avoid obvious user names, because hackers typically use them with
brute force hacks (e.g., ``root``,  ``admin``, ``{productname}``). The following
procedure, substituting  ``{username}`` for the user name you define, describes
how to create a user  with passwordless ``sudo``.

#. Create a user on each Ceph Node. ::

	ssh user@ceph-server
	sudo useradd -d /home/{username} -m {username}
	sudo passwd {username}

#. For the user you added to each Ceph node, ensure that the user has
   ``sudo`` privileges. ::

	echo "{username} ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/{username}
	sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/{username}


Enable Password-less SSH
------------------------

Since ``ceph-deploy`` will not prompt for a password, you must generate
SSH keys on the admin node and distribute the public key to each Ceph node.

.. note:: ``ceph-deploy`` v1.1.3 and later releases will attempt to generate
   the SSH keys for initial monitors. 

#. Generate the SSH keys, but do not use ``sudo`` or the
   ``root`` user. Leave the passphrase empty::

	ssh-keygen
	
	Generating public/private key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/ceph-admin/.ssh/id_rsa):
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:
	Your identification has been saved in /ceph-admin/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /ceph-admin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

#. Copy the key to each Ceph Node, replacing ``{username}`` with the user name
   you created with `Create a Ceph User`_. ::

	ssh-copy-id {username}@node1
	ssh-copy-id {username}@node2
	ssh-copy-id {username}@node3

#. (Recommended) Modify the ``~/.ssh/config`` file of your ``ceph-deploy`` 
   admin node so that ``ceph-deploy`` can log in to Ceph nodes as the user you 
   created without requiring you to specify ``--username {username}`` each 
   time you execute ``ceph-deploy``. This has the added benefit of streamlining
   ``ssh`` and ``scp`` usage. Replace ``{username}`` with the user name you
   created::

	Host node1
	   Hostname node1
	   User {username}
	Host node2
	   Hostname node2
	   User {username}
	Host node3
	   Hostname node3
	   User {username}


Enable Networking On Bootup
---------------------------

Ceph OSDs peer with each other and report to Ceph Monitors over the network.
If networking is ``off`` by default, the Ceph cluster cannot come online
during bootup until you enable networking.

The default configuration on some distributions (e.g., CentOS) has the
networking interface(s) off by default. Ensure that, during boot up, your
network interface(s) turn(s) on so that your Ceph daemons can communicate over
the network. For example, on Red Hat and CentOS, navigate to
``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`` and ensure that the  ``ifcfg-{iface}`` file
has ``ONBOOT`` set to ``yes``.


Ensure Connectivity
-------------------

Ensure connectivity using ``ping`` with short hostnames (``hostname -s``).
Address hostname resolution issues as necessary.
   
.. note:: Hostnames should resolve to a network IP address, not to the
   loopback IP address (e.g., hostnames should resolve to an IP address other
   than ``127.0.0.1``). If you use your admin node as a Ceph node, you 
   should also ensure that it resolves to its hostname and IP address
   (i.e., not its loopback IP address).


Open Required Ports
-------------------

Ceph Monitors communicate using port ``6789`` by default. Ceph OSDs communicate
in a port range of ``6800:7810`` by default. See the `Network Configuration
Reference`_ for details. Ceph OSDs can use multiple network connections to
communicate with clients, monitors, other OSDs for replication, and other OSDs
for heartbeats.

On some distributions (e.g., RHEL), the default firewall configuration is fairly
strict. You may need to adjust your firewall settings allow inbound requests so
that clients in your network can communicate with daemons on your Ceph nodes.

For ``firewalld`` on RHEL 7, add port ``6789`` for Ceph Monitor nodes and ports
``6800:7100`` for Ceph OSDs to the public zone and ensure that you make the
setting permanent so that it is enabled on reboot. For example::

	sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=6789/tcp --permanent

For ``iptables``, add port ``6789`` for Ceph Monitors and ports ``6800:7100`` 
for Ceph OSDs. For example::

	sudo iptables -A INPUT -i {iface} -p tcp -s {ip-address}/{netmask} --dport 6789 -j ACCEPT

Once you have finished configuring ``iptables``, ensure that you make the
changes persistent on each node so that they will be in effect when your nodes
reboot. For example::

	/sbin/service iptables save

TTY
---

On CentOS and RHEL, you may receive an error while trying to execute
``ceph-deploy`` commands. If ``requiretty`` is set by default on your Ceph
nodes, disable it by executing ``sudo visudo`` and locate the ``Defaults
requiretty`` setting. Change it to ``Defaults:ceph !requiretty`` or comment it
out to ensure that ``ceph-deploy`` can connect using the user you created with
`Create a Ceph User`_.

.. note:: If editing, ``/etc/sudoers``, ensure that you use
   ``sudo visudo`` rather than a text editor.


SELinux
-------

On CentOS and RHEL, SELinux is set to ``Enforcing`` by default. To streamline your
installation, we recommend setting SELinux to ``Permissive`` or disabling it
entirely and ensuring that your installation and cluster are working properly
before hardening your configuration. To set SELinux to ``Permissive``, execute the
following::

	sudo setenforce 0

To configure SELinux persistently (recommended if SELinux is an issue), modify
the configuration file at  ``/etc/selinux/config``.
